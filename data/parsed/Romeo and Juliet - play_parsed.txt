D: ﻿CHORUS.
D: Two households, both alike in dignity,
D: In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
D: From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
D: Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
D: From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
D: A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
D: Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
D: Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
D: The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
D: And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
D: Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
D: Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
D: The which, if you with patient ears attend,
D: What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
D:  [_Exit._]
M: ACT I
M: SCENE I. A public place.
D:  Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.
C: SAMPSON.
D: Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.
C: GREGORY.
D: No, for then we should be colliers.
C: SAMPSON.
D: I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.
C: GREGORY.
D: Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.
C: SAMPSON.
D: I strike quickly, being moved.
C: GREGORY.
D: But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
C: SAMPSON.
D: A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
C: GREGORY.
D: To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou
D: art moved, thou runn’st away.
C: SAMPSON.
D: A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
D: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
C: GREGORY.
D: That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.
C: SAMPSON.
D: True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to
D: the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and
D: thrust his maids to the wall.
C: GREGORY.
D: The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
C: SAMPSON.
D: ’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the
D: men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.
C: GREGORY.
D: The heads of the maids?
C: SAMPSON.
D: Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
D: thou wilt.
C: GREGORY.
D: They must take it in sense that feel it.
C: SAMPSON.
D: Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a
D: pretty piece of flesh.
C: GREGORY.
D: ’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.
D: Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.
D:  Enter Abram and Balthasar.
C: SAMPSON.
D: My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
C: GREGORY.
D: How? Turn thy back and run?
C: SAMPSON.
D: Fear me not.
C: GREGORY.
D: No, marry; I fear thee!
C: SAMPSON.
D: Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
C: GREGORY.
D: I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
C: SAMPSON.
D: Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to
D: them if they bear it.
C: ABRAM.
D: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
C: SAMPSON.
D: I do bite my thumb, sir.
C: ABRAM.
D: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
C: SAMPSON.
D: Is the law of our side if I say ay?
C: GREGORY.
D: No.
C: SAMPSON.
D: No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.
C: GREGORY.
D: Do you quarrel, sir?
C: ABRAM.
D: Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
C: SAMPSON.
D: But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
C: ABRAM.
D: No better.
C: SAMPSON.
D: Well, sir.
D:  Enter Benvolio.
C: GREGORY.
D: Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.
C: SAMPSON.
D: Yes, better, sir.
C: ABRAM.
D: You lie.
C: SAMPSON.
D: Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.
D:  [_They fight._]
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.
D:  [_Beats down their swords._]
D:  Enter Tybalt.
C: TYBALT.
D: What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
D: Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,
D: Or manage it to part these men with me.
C: TYBALT.
D: What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
D: As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
D: Have at thee, coward.
D:  [_They fight._]
D:  Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.
C: FIRST CITIZEN.
D: Clubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!
D: Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
D:  Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.
C: CAPULET.
D: What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
C: CAPULET.
D: My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
D: And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
D:  Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.
C: MONTAGUE.
D: Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.
C: LADY MONTAGUE.
D: Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
D:  Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.
C: PRINCE.
D: Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
D: Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
D: Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,
D: That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
D: With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
D: On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
D: Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground
D: And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
D: Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
D: By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
D: Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
D: And made Verona’s ancient citizens
D: Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
D: To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
D: Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.
D: If ever you disturb our streets again,
D: Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
D: For this time all the rest depart away:
D: You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
D: And Montague, come you this afternoon,
D: To know our farther pleasure in this case,
D: To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.
D: Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
D:  [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,
D:  Citizens and Servants._]
C: MONTAGUE.
D: Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
D: Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Here were the servants of your adversary
D: And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
D: I drew to part them, in the instant came
D: The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,
D: Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
D: He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
D: Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.
D: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
D: Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
D: Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
C: LADY MONTAGUE.
D: O where is Romeo, saw you him today?
D: Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun
D: Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,
D: A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
D: Where underneath the grove of sycamore
D: That westward rooteth from this city side,
D: So early walking did I see your son.
D: Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
D: And stole into the covert of the wood.
D: I, measuring his affections by my own,
D: Which then most sought where most might not be found,
D: Being one too many by my weary self,
D: Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,
D: And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.
C: MONTAGUE.
D: Many a morning hath he there been seen,
D: With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
D: Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
D: But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
D: Should in the farthest east begin to draw
D: The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
D: Away from light steals home my heavy son,
D: And private in his chamber pens himself,
D: Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
D: And makes himself an artificial night.
D: Black and portentous must this humour prove,
D: Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
C: MONTAGUE.
D: I neither know it nor can learn of him.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Have you importun’d him by any means?
C: MONTAGUE.
D: Both by myself and many other friends;
D: But he, his own affections’ counsellor,
D: Is to himself—I will not say how true—
D: But to himself so secret and so close,
D: So far from sounding and discovery,
D: As is the bud bit with an envious worm
D: Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
D: Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
D: Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
D: We would as willingly give cure as know.
D:  Enter Romeo.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: See, where he comes. So please you step aside;
D: I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.
C: MONTAGUE.
D: I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
D: To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,
D:  [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Good morrow, cousin.
C: ROMEO.
D: Is the day so young?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: But new struck nine.
C: ROMEO.
D: Ay me, sad hours seem long.
D: Was that my father that went hence so fast?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?
C: ROMEO.
D: Not having that which, having, makes them short.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: In love?
C: ROMEO.
D: Out.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Of love?
C: ROMEO.
D: Out of her favour where I am in love.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Alas that love so gentle in his view,
D: Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.
C: ROMEO.
D: Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
D: Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
D: Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
D: Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
D: Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:
D: Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
D: O anything, of nothing first create!
D: O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
D: Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
D: Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
D: Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
D: This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
D: Dost thou not laugh?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: No coz, I rather weep.
C: ROMEO.
D: Good heart, at what?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: At thy good heart’s oppression.
C: ROMEO.
D: Why such is love’s transgression.
D: Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
D: Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
D: With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
D: Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
D: Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
D: Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;
D: Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:
D: What is it else? A madness most discreet,
D: A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
D: Farewell, my coz.
D:  [_Going._]
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Soft! I will go along:
D: And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
C: ROMEO.
D: Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.
D: This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
C: ROMEO.
D: What, shall I groan and tell thee?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.
C: ROMEO.
D: Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,
D: A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.
D: In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.
C: ROMEO.
D: A right good markman, and she’s fair I love.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
C: ROMEO.
D: Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
D: With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;
D: And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,
D: From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.
D: She will not stay the siege of loving terms
D: Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,
D: Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
D: O she’s rich in beauty, only poor
D: That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
C: ROMEO.
D: She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
D: For beauty starv’d with her severity,
D: Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
D: She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
D: To merit bliss by making me despair.
D: She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
D: Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.
C: ROMEO.
D: O teach me how I should forget to think.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
D: Examine other beauties.
C: ROMEO.
D: ’Tis the way
D: To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
D: These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,
D: Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
D: He that is strucken blind cannot forget
D: The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
D: Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
D: What doth her beauty serve but as a note
D: Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?
D: Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE II. A Street.
D:  Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.
C: CAPULET.
D: But Montague is bound as well as I,
D: In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,
D: For men so old as we to keep the peace.
C: PARIS.
D: Of honourable reckoning are you both,
D: And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
D: But now my lord, what say you to my suit?
C: CAPULET.
D: But saying o’er what I have said before.
D: My child is yet a stranger in the world,
D: She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
D: Let two more summers wither in their pride
D: Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
C: PARIS.
D: Younger than she are happy mothers made.
C: CAPULET.
D: And too soon marr’d are those so early made.
D: The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
D: She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
D: But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
D: My will to her consent is but a part;
D: And she agree, within her scope of choice
D: Lies my consent and fair according voice.
D: This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,
D: Whereto I have invited many a guest,
D: Such as I love, and you among the store,
D: One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
D: At my poor house look to behold this night
D: Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
D: Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
D: When well apparell’d April on the heel
D: Of limping winter treads, even such delight
D: Among fresh female buds shall you this night
D: Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
D: And like her most whose merit most shall be:
D: Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
D: May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
D: Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about
D: Through fair Verona; find those persons out
D: Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,
D: My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
D:  [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]
C: SERVANT.
D: Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the
D: shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the
D: fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to
D: find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what
D: names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good
D: time!
D:  Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,
D: One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;
D: Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
D: One desperate grief cures with another’s languish:
D: Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
D: And the rank poison of the old will die.
C: ROMEO.
D: Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: For what, I pray thee?
C: ROMEO.
D: For your broken shin.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
C: ROMEO.
D: Not mad, but bound more than a madman is:
D: Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
D: Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.
C: SERVANT.
D: God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
C: ROMEO.
D: Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
C: SERVANT.
D: Perhaps you have learned it without book.
D: But I pray, can you read anything you see?
C: ROMEO.
D: Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
C: SERVANT.
D: Ye say honestly, rest you merry!
C: ROMEO.
D: Stay, fellow; I can read.
D:  [_He reads the letter._]
D: _Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
D: County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
D: The lady widow of Utruvio;
D: Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;
D: Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
D: Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
D: My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
D: Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;
D: Lucio and the lively Helena. _
D: A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?
C: SERVANT.
D: Up.
C: ROMEO.
D: Whither to supper?
C: SERVANT.
D: To our house.
C: ROMEO.
D: Whose house?
C: SERVANT.
D: My master’s.
C: ROMEO.
D: Indeed I should have ask’d you that before.
C: SERVANT.
D: Now I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet,
D: and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a
D: cup of wine. Rest you merry.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: BENVOLIO.
D: At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s
D: Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;
D: With all the admired beauties of Verona.
D: Go thither and with unattainted eye,
D: Compare her face with some that I shall show,
D: And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
C: ROMEO.
D: When the devout religion of mine eye
D: Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;
D: And these who, often drown’d, could never die,
D: Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.
D: One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
D: Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
D: Herself pois’d with herself in either eye:
D: But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d
D: Your lady’s love against some other maid
D: That I will show you shining at this feast,
D: And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
C: ROMEO.
D: I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,
D: But to rejoice in splendour of my own.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE III. Room in Capulet’s House.
D:  Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.
C: NURSE.
D: Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
D: I bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!
D: God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!
D:  Enter Juliet.
C: JULIET.
D: How now, who calls?
C: NURSE.
D: Your mother.
C: JULIET.
D: Madam, I am here. What is your will?
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,
D: We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,
D: I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.
D: Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.
C: NURSE.
D: Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: She’s not fourteen.
C: NURSE.
D: I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,
D: And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,
D: She is not fourteen. How long is it now
D: To Lammas-tide?
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: A fortnight and odd days.
C: NURSE.
D: Even or odd, of all days in the year,
D: Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
D: Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—
D: Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
D: She was too good for me. But as I said,
D: On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
D: That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
D: ’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
D: And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,
D: Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
D: For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
D: Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;
D: My lord and you were then at Mantua:
D: Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,
D: When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
D: Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
D: To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
D: Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,
D: To bid me trudge.
D: And since that time it is eleven years;
D: For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood
D: She could have run and waddled all about;
D: For even the day before she broke her brow,
D: And then my husband,—God be with his soul!
D: A was a merry man,—took up the child:
D: ‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?
D: Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
D: Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,
D: The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.
D: To see now how a jest shall come about.
D: I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,
D: I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;
D: And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.
C: NURSE.
D: Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,
D: To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;
D: And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
D: A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;
D: A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
D: ‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?
D: Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
D: Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.
C: JULIET.
D: And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.
C: NURSE.
D: Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace
D: Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:
D: And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Marry, that marry is the very theme
D: I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
D: How stands your disposition to be married?
C: JULIET.
D: It is an honour that I dream not of.
C: NURSE.
D: An honour! Were not I thine only nurse,
D: I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
D: Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
D: Are made already mothers. By my count
D: I was your mother much upon these years
D: That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;
D: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
C: NURSE.
D: A man, young lady! Lady, such a man
D: As all the world—why he’s a man of wax.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.
C: NURSE.
D: Nay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: What say you, can you love the gentleman?
D: This night you shall behold him at our feast;
D: Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,
D: And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.
D: Examine every married lineament,
D: And see how one another lends content;
D: And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,
D: Find written in the margent of his eyes.
D: This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
D: To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
D: The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride
D: For fair without the fair within to hide.
D: That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,
D: That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
D: So shall you share all that he doth possess,
D: By having him, making yourself no less.
C: NURSE.
D: No less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?
C: JULIET.
D: I’ll look to like, if looking liking move:
D: But no more deep will I endart mine eye
D: Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
D:  Enter a Servant.
C: SERVANT.
D: Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady
D: asked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.
D: I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: We follow thee.
D:  [_Exit Servant._]
D: Juliet, the County stays.
C: NURSE.
D: Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE IV. A Street.
D:  Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;
D:  Torch-bearers and others.
C: ROMEO.
D: What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
D: Or shall we on without apology?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: The date is out of such prolixity:
D: We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,
D: Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,
D: Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
D: Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
D: After the prompter, for our entrance:
D: But let them measure us by what they will,
D: We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.
C: ROMEO.
D: Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling;
D: Being but heavy I will bear the light.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
C: ROMEO.
D: Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,
D: With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead
D: So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,
D: And soar with them above a common bound.
C: ROMEO.
D: I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
D: To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
D: I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
D: Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
D: Too great oppression for a tender thing.
C: ROMEO.
D: Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
D: Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
D: Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
D: Give me a case to put my visage iC: [_Putting on a mask._]
D: A visor for a visor. What care I
D: What curious eye doth quote deformities?
D: Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
D: But every man betake him to his legs.
C: ROMEO.
D: A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,
D: Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
D: For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,
D: I’ll be a candle-holder and look on,
D: The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:
D: If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire
D: Or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest
D: Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.
C: ROMEO.
D: Nay, that’s not so.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: I mean sir, in delay
D: We waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.
D: Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
D: Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
C: ROMEO.
D: And we mean well in going to this mask;
D: But ’tis no wit to go.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Why, may one ask?
C: ROMEO.
D: I dreamt a dream tonight.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: And so did I.
C: ROMEO.
D: Well what was yours?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: That dreamers often lie.
C: ROMEO.
D: In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
D: She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
D: In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
D: On the fore-finger of an alderman,
D: Drawn with a team of little atomies
D: Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:
D: Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;
D: The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
D: Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;
D: The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;
D: Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;
D: Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
D: Not half so big as a round little worm
D: Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:
D: Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
D: Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
D: Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
D: And in this state she gallops night by night
D: Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
D: O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
D: O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
D: O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
D: Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
D: Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
D: Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
D: And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
D: And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
D: Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,
D: Then dreams he of another benefice:
D: Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
D: And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
D: Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,
D: Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
D: Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
D: And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
D: And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
D: That plats the manes of horses in the night;
D: And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
D: Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
D: This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
D: That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
D: Making them women of good carriage:
D: This is she,—
C: ROMEO.
D: Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
D: Thou talk’st of nothing.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: True, I talk of dreams,
D: Which are the children of an idle brain,
D: Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
D: Which is as thin of substance as the air,
D: And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
D: Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
D: And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,
D: Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
D: Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
C: ROMEO.
D: I fear too early: for my mind misgives
D: Some consequence yet hanging in the stars,
D: Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
D: With this night’s revels; and expire the term
D: Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast
D: By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
D: But he that hath the steerage of my course
D: Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Strike, drum.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.
D:  Musicians waiting. Enter Servants.
C: FIRST SERVANT.
D: Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
D: He shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!
C: SECOND SERVANT.
D: When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they
D: unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.
C: FIRST SERVANT.
D: Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the
D: plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me,
D: let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan!
C: SECOND SERVANT.
D: Ay, boy, ready.
C: FIRST SERVANT.
D: You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the
D: great chamber.
C: SECOND SERVANT.
D: We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys. Be brisk awhile, and
D: the longer liver take all.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
D:  Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
C: CAPULET.
D: Welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes
D: Unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.
D: Ah my mistresses, which of you all
D: Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
D: She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
D: Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
D: That I have worn a visor, and could tell
D: A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,
D: Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,
D: You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
D: A hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls.
D:  [_Music plays, and they dance._]
D: More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
D: And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
D: Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.
D: Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,
D: For you and I are past our dancing days;
D: How long is’t now since last yourself and I
D: Were in a mask?
D: CAPULET’S COUSIN.
D: By’r Lady, thirty years.
C: CAPULET.
D: What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
D: ’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
D: Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
D: Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.
D: CAPULET’S COUSIN.
D: ’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;
D: His son is thirty.
C: CAPULET.
D: Will you tell me that?
D: His son was but a ward two years ago.
C: ROMEO.
D: What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
D: Of yonder knight?
C: SERVANT.
D: I know not, sir.
C: ROMEO.
D: O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
D: It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
D: As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;
D: Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
D: So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
D: As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
D: The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,
D: And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
D: Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
D: For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.
C: TYBALT.
D: This by his voice, should be a Montague.
D: Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
D: Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,
D: To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
D: Now by the stock and honour of my kin,
D: To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
C: CAPULET.
D: Why how now, kinsman!
D: Wherefore storm you so?
C: TYBALT.
D: Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
D: A villain that is hither come in spite,
D: To scorn at our solemnity this night.
C: CAPULET.
D: Young Romeo, is it?
C: TYBALT.
D: ’Tis he, that villain Romeo.
C: CAPULET.
D: Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
D: A bears him like a portly gentleman;
D: And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
D: To be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.
D: I would not for the wealth of all the town
D: Here in my house do him disparagement.
D: Therefore be patient, take no note of him,
D: It is my will; the which if thou respect,
D: Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
D: An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
C: TYBALT.
D: It fits when such a villain is a guest:
D: I’ll not endure him.
C: CAPULET.
D: He shall be endur’d.
D: What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;
D: Am I the master here, or you? Go to.
D: You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,
D: You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
D: You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!
C: TYBALT.
D: Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
C: CAPULET.
D: Go to, go to!
D: You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?
D: This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
D: You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time.
D: Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:
D: Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!
D: I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts.
C: TYBALT.
D: Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
D: Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
D: I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
D: Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: ROMEO.
D: [_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
D: This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
D: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
D: To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
C: JULIET.
D: Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
D: Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
D: For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
D: And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.
C: ROMEO.
D: Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
C: JULIET.
D: Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
C: ROMEO.
D: O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:
D: They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
C: JULIET.
D: Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.
C: ROMEO.
D: Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.
D: Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d.
T: [_Kissing her._]
C: JULIET.
D: Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
C: ROMEO.
D: Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d!
D: Give me my sin again.
C: JULIET.
D: You kiss by the book.
C: NURSE.
D: Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
C: ROMEO.
D: What is her mother?
C: NURSE.
D: Marry, bachelor,
D: Her mother is the lady of the house,
D: And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
D: I nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal.
D: I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
D: Shall have the chinks.
C: ROMEO.
D: Is she a Capulet?
D: O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
C: ROMEO.
D: Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
C: CAPULET.
D: Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
D: We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
D: Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;
D: I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
D: More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed.
D: Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
D: I’ll to my rest.
D:  [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._]
C: JULIET.
D: Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?
C: NURSE.
D: The son and heir of old Tiberio.
C: JULIET.
D: What’s he that now is going out of door?
C: NURSE.
D: Marry, that I think be young Petruchio.
C: JULIET.
D: What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?
C: NURSE.
D: I know not.
C: JULIET.
D: Go ask his name. If he be married,
D: My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
C: NURSE.
D: His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
D: The only son of your great enemy.
C: JULIET.
D: My only love sprung from my only hate!
D: Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
D: Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
D: That I must love a loathed enemy.
C: NURSE.
D: What’s this? What’s this?
C: JULIET.
D: A rhyme I learn’d even now
D: Of one I danc’d withal.
D:  [_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._]
C: NURSE.
D: Anon, anon!
D: Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: ACT II
D:  Enter Chorus.
C: CHORUS.
D: Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
D: And young affection gapes to be his heir;
D: That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,
D: With tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair.
D: Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,
D: Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
D: But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,
D: And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
D: Being held a foe, he may not have access
D: To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
D: And she as much in love, her means much less
D: To meet her new beloved anywhere.
D: But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
D: Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
D:  [_Exit._]
M: SCENE I. An open place adjoining Capulet’s Garden.
D:  Enter Romeo.
C: ROMEO.
D: Can I go forward when my heart is here?
D: Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
D:  [_He climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]
D:  Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Romeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!
C: MERCUTIO.
D: He is wise,
D: And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: He ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:
D: Call, good Mercutio.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Nay, I’ll conjure too.
D: Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover!
D: Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,
D: Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
D: Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;
D: Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
D: One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
D: Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
D: When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
D: He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
D: The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
D: I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,
D: By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
D: By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
D: And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
D: That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him
D: To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,
D: Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
D: Till she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;
D: That were some spite. My invocation
D: Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,
D: I conjure only but to raise up him.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
D: To be consorted with the humorous night.
D: Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
D: Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
D: And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
D: As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
D: O Romeo, that she were, O that she were
D: An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
D: Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.
D: This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
D: Come, shall we go?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Go then; for ’tis in vain
D: To seek him here that means not to be found.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE II. Capulet’s Garden.
D:  Enter Romeo.
C: ROMEO.
D: He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
D:  Juliet appears above at a window.
D: But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
D: It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
D: Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,
D: Who is already sick and pale with grief,
D: That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
D: Be not her maid since she is envious;
D: Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
D: And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
D: It is my lady, O it is my love!
D: O, that she knew she were!
D: She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
D: Her eye discourses, I will answer it.
D: I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.
D: Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
D: Having some business, do entreat her eyes
D: To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
D: What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
D: The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
D: As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
D: Would through the airy region stream so bright
D: That birds would sing and think it were not night.
D: See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
D: O that I were a glove upon that hand,
D: That I might touch that cheek.
C: JULIET.
D: Ay me.
C: ROMEO.
D: She speaks.
D: O speak again bright angel, for thou art
D: As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,
D: As is a winged messenger of heaven
D: Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
D: Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
D: When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
D: And sails upon the bosom of the air.
C: JULIET.
D: O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
D: Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
D: Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
D: And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
C: ROMEO.
D: [_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
C: JULIET.
D: ’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
D: Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
D: What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,
D: Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
D: Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
D: What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
D: By any other name would smell as sweet;
D: So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,
D: Retain that dear perfection which he owes
D: Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
D: And for thy name, which is no part of thee,
D: Take all myself.
C: ROMEO.
D: I take thee at thy word.
D: Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;
D: Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
C: JULIET.
D: What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night
D: So stumblest on my counsel?
C: ROMEO.
D: By a name
D: I know not how to tell thee who I am:
D: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
D: Because it is an enemy to thee.
D: Had I it written, I would tear the word.
C: JULIET.
D: My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
D: Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.
D: Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
C: ROMEO.
D: Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
C: JULIET.
D: How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
D: The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
D: And the place death, considering who thou art,
D: If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
C: ROMEO.
D: With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,
D: For stony limits cannot hold love out,
D: And what love can do, that dares love attempt:
D: Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
C: JULIET.
D: If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
C: ROMEO.
D: Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
D: Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
D: And I am proof against their enmity.
C: JULIET.
D: I would not for the world they saw thee here.
C: ROMEO.
D: I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,
D: And but thou love me, let them find me here.
D: My life were better ended by their hate
D: Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
C: JULIET.
D: By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
C: ROMEO.
D: By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
D: He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
D: I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far
D: As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,
D: I should adventure for such merchandise.
C: JULIET.
D: Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
D: Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
D: For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
D: Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
D: What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.
D: Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,
D: And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,
D: Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,
D: They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
D: If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
D: Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
D: I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
D: So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.
D: In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;
D: And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:
D: But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true
D: Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
D: I should have been more strange, I must confess,
D: But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,
D: My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,
D: And not impute this yielding to light love,
D: Which the dark night hath so discovered.
C: ROMEO.
D: Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
D: That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—
C: JULIET.
D: O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,
D: That monthly changes in her circled orb,
D: Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
C: ROMEO.
D: What shall I swear by?
C: JULIET.
D: Do not swear at all.
D: Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
D: Which is the god of my idolatry,
D: And I’ll believe thee.
C: ROMEO.
D: If my heart’s dear love,—
C: JULIET.
D: Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
D: I have no joy of this contract tonight;
D: It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
D: Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
D: Ere one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.
D: This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,
D: May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
D: Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest
D: Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
C: ROMEO.
D: O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
C: JULIET.
D: What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
C: ROMEO.
D: Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
C: JULIET.
D: I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
D: And yet I would it were to give again.
C: ROMEO.
D: Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
C: JULIET.
D: But to be frank and give it thee again.
D: And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
D: My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
D: My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
D: The more I have, for both are infinite.
D: I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
T: [_Nurse calls within._]
D: Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.
D: Stay but a little, I will come again.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: ROMEO.
D: O blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,
D: Being in night, all this is but a dream,
D: Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
D:  Enter Juliet above.
C: JULIET.
D: Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
D: If that thy bent of love be honourable,
D: Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
D: By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,
D: Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
D: And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay
D: And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
C: NURSE.
D: [_Within._] Madam.
C: JULIET.
D: I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,
D: I do beseech thee,—
C: NURSE.
D: [_Within._] Madam.
C: JULIET.
D: By and by I come—
D: To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
D: Tomorrow will I send.
C: ROMEO.
D: So thrive my soul,—
C: JULIET.
D: A thousand times good night.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: ROMEO.
D: A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
D: Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
D: But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
D:  [_Retiring slowly._]
D:  Re-enter Juliet, above.
C: JULIET.
D: Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice
D: To lure this tassel-gentle back again.
D: Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
D: Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
D: And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
D: With repetition of my Romeo’s name.
C: ROMEO.
D: It is my soul that calls upon my name.
D: How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,
D: Like softest music to attending ears.
C: JULIET.
D: Romeo.
C: ROMEO.
D: My nyas?
C: JULIET.
D: What o’clock tomorrow
D: Shall I send to thee?
C: ROMEO.
D: By the hour of nine.
C: JULIET.
D: I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.
D: I have forgot why I did call thee back.
C: ROMEO.
D: Let me stand here till thou remember it.
C: JULIET.
D: I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
D: Remembering how I love thy company.
C: ROMEO.
D: And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,
D: Forgetting any other home but this.
C: JULIET.
D: ’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,
D: And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
D: That lets it hop a little from her hand,
D: Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
D: And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
D: So loving-jealous of his liberty.
C: ROMEO.
D: I would I were thy bird.
C: JULIET.
D: Sweet, so would I:
D: Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
D: Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow
D: That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: ROMEO.
D: Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
D: Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
D: Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,
D: His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
D:  [_Exit._]
M: SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
D:  Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
D: Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;
D: And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
D: From forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s fiery wheels
D: Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
D: The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,
D: I must upfill this osier cage of ours
D: With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
D: The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;
D: What is her burying grave, that is her womb:
D: And from her womb children of divers kind
D: We sucking on her natural bosom find.
D: Many for many virtues excellent,
D: None but for some, and yet all different.
D: O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
D: In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
D: For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
D: But to the earth some special good doth give;
D: Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,
D: Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
D: Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied,
D: And vice sometime’s by action dignified.
D:  Enter Romeo.
D: Within the infant rind of this weak flower
D: Poison hath residence, and medicine power:
D: For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
D: Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
D: Two such opposed kings encamp them still
D: In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;
D: And where the worser is predominant,
D: Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
C: ROMEO.
D: Good morrow, father.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Benedicite!
D: What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
D: Young son, it argues a distemper’d head
D: So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
D: Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
D: And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
D: But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain
D: Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
D: Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
D: Thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;
D: Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
D: Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
C: ROMEO.
D: That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: God pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?
C: ROMEO.
D: With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
D: I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?
C: ROMEO.
D: I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
D: I have been feasting with mine enemy,
D: Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
D: That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies
D: Within thy help and holy physic lies.
D: I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,
D: My intercession likewise steads my foe.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
D: Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
C: ROMEO.
D: Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set
D: On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
D: As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
D: And all combin’d, save what thou must combine
D: By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
D: We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
D: I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
D: That thou consent to marry us today.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
D: Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
D: So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies
D: Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
D: Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
D: Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
D: How much salt water thrown away in waste,
D: To season love, that of it doth not taste.
D: The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
D: Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.
D: Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
D: Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.
D: If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
D: Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,
D: And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,
D: Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.
C: ROMEO.
D: Thou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
C: ROMEO.
D: And bad’st me bury love.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Not in a grave
D: To lay one in, another out to have.
C: ROMEO.
D: I pray thee chide me not, her I love now
D: Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
D: The other did not so.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: O, she knew well
D: Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
D: But come young waverer, come go with me,
D: In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
D: For this alliance may so happy prove,
D: To turn your households’ rancour to pure love.
C: ROMEO.
D: O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE IV. A Street.
D:  Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Not to his father’s; I spoke with his man.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so
D: that he will sure run mad.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s
D: house.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: A challenge, on my life.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Romeo will answer it.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Any man that can write may answer a letter.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Alas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black
D: eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart
D: cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter
D: Tybalt?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Why, what is Tybalt?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: More than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of
D: compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,
D: and proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in
D: your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;
D: a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,
D: the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: The what?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners
D: of accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good
D: whore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should
D: be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,
D: these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot
D: sit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!
D:  Enter Romeo.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou
D: fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to
D: his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to
D: berhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings
D: and harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
D: Romeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You
D: gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
C: ROMEO.
D: Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: The slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
C: ROMEO.
D: Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as
D: mine a man may strain courtesy.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow
D: in the hams.
C: ROMEO.
D: Meaning, to curtsy.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Thou hast most kindly hit it.
C: ROMEO.
D: A most courteous exposition.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
C: ROMEO.
D: Pink for flower.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Right.
C: ROMEO.
D: Why, then is my pump well flowered.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,
D: that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the
D: wearing, solely singular.
C: ROMEO.
D: O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
C: ROMEO.
D: Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast
D: more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my
D: whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
C: ROMEO.
D: Thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the
D: goose.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
C: ROMEO.
D: Nay, good goose, bite not.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.
C: ROMEO.
D: And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: O here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an
D: ell broad.
C: ROMEO.
D: I stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves
D: thee far and wide a broad goose.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou
D: sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as
D: well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,
D: that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Stop there, stop there.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the
D: whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
D: longer.
D:  Enter Nurse and Peter.
C: ROMEO.
D: Here’s goodly gear!
D: A sail, a sail!
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
C: NURSE.
D: Peter!
C: PETER.
D: Anon.
C: NURSE.
D: My fan, Peter.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.
C: NURSE.
D: God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
C: NURSE.
D: Is it good-den?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: ’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the
D: prick of noon.
C: NURSE.
D: Out upon you! What a man are you?
C: ROMEO.
D: One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
C: NURSE.
D: By my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,
D: can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?
C: ROMEO.
D: I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him
D: than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for
D: fault of a worse.
C: NURSE.
D: You say well.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.
C: NURSE.
D: If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: She will endite him to some supper.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
C: ROMEO.
D: What hast thou found?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something
D: stale and hoar ere it be spent.
T: [_Sings._]
D:     An old hare hoar,
D:     And an old hare hoar,
D:   Is very good meat in Lent;
D:     But a hare that is hoar
D:     Is too much for a score
D:   When it hoars ere it be spent.
D: Romeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.
C: ROMEO.
D: I will follow you.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.
D:  [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]
C: NURSE.
D: I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his
D: ropery?
C: ROMEO.
D: A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak
D: more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
C: NURSE.
D: And a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier
D: than he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those
D: that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of
D: his skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to
D: use me at his pleasure!
C: PETER.
D: I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should
D: quickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another
D: man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.
C: NURSE.
D: Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy
D: knave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me
D: enquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first
D: let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they
D: say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the
D: gentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with
D: her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and
D: very weak dealing.
D: ROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
D: thee,—
C: NURSE.
D: Good heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will
D: be a joyful woman.
C: ROMEO.
D: What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
C: NURSE.
D: I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a
D: gentlemanlike offer.
C: ROMEO.
D: Bid her devise
D: Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
D: And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell
D: Be shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.
C: NURSE.
D: No truly, sir; not a penny.
C: ROMEO.
D: Go to; I say you shall.
C: NURSE.
D: This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
C: ROMEO.
D: And stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.
D: Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
D: And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
D: Which to the high topgallant of my joy
D: Must be my convoy in the secret night.
D: Farewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;
D: Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
C: NURSE.
D: Now God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.
C: ROMEO.
D: What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?
C: NURSE.
D: Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,
D: Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
C: ROMEO.
D: I warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.
C: NURSE.
D: Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a
D: little prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that
D: would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a
D: toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that
D: Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she
D: looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and
D: Romeo begin both with a letter?
C: ROMEO.
D: Ay, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
C: NURSE.
D: Ah, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins
D: with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,
D: of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.
C: ROMEO.
D: Commend me to thy lady.
C: NURSE.
D: Ay, a thousand times. Peter!
D:  [_Exit Romeo._]
C: PETER.
D: Anon.
C: NURSE.
D: Before and apace.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.
D:  Enter Juliet.
C: JULIET.
D: The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,
D: In half an hour she promised to return.
D: Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.
D: O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,
D: Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,
D: Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
D: Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,
D: And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
D: Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
D: Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve
D: Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
D: Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
D: She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
D: My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
D: And his to me.
D: But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
D: Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
D:  Enter Nurse and Peter.
D: O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?
D: Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
C: NURSE.
D: Peter, stay at the gate.
D:  [_Exit Peter._]
C: JULIET.
D: Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?
D: Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
D: If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news
D: By playing it to me with so sour a face.
C: NURSE.
D: I am aweary, give me leave awhile;
D: Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!
C: JULIET.
D: I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
D: Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.
C: NURSE.
D: Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am
D: out of breath?
C: JULIET.
D: How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
D: To say to me that thou art out of breath?
D: The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
D: Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
D: Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;
D: Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
D: Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?
C: NURSE.
D: Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.
D: Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his
D: leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though
D: they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the
D: flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
D: ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?
C: JULIET.
D: No, no. But all this did I know before.
D: What says he of our marriage? What of that?
C: NURSE.
D: Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
D: It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
D: My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!
D: Beshrew your heart for sending me about
D: To catch my death with jauncing up and down.
C: JULIET.
D: I’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
D: Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?
C: NURSE.
D: Your love says like an honest gentleman,
D: And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
D: And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?
C: JULIET.
D: Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
D: Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest.
D: ‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
D: ‘Where is your mother?’
C: NURSE.
D: O God’s lady dear,
D: Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.
D: Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
D: Henceforward do your messages yourself.
C: JULIET.
D: Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?
C: NURSE.
D: Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
C: JULIET.
D: I have.
C: NURSE.
D: Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;
D: There stays a husband to make you a wife.
D: Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
D: They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
D: Hie you to church. I must another way,
D: To fetch a ladder by the which your love
D: Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
D: I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
D: But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
D: Go. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
C: JULIET.
D: Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
D:  Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: So smile the heavens upon this holy act
D: That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
C: ROMEO.
D: Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,
D: It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
D: That one short minute gives me in her sight.
D: Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
D: Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
D: It is enough I may but call her mine.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: These violent delights have violent ends,
D: And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
D: Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
D: Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
D: And in the taste confounds the appetite.
D: Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
D: Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
D:  Enter Juliet.
D: Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
D: Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.
D: A lover may bestride the gossamers
D: That idles in the wanton summer air
D: And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
C: JULIET.
D: Good even to my ghostly confessor.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
C: JULIET.
D: As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
C: ROMEO.
D: Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
D: Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more
D: To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
D: This neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue
D: Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
D: Receive in either by this dear encounter.
C: JULIET.
D: Conceit more rich in matter than in words,
D: Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
D: They are but beggars that can count their worth;
D: But my true love is grown to such excess,
D: I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
D: For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
D: Till holy church incorporate two in one.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: ACT III
M: SCENE I. A public Place.
D:  Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:
D: The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
D: And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
D: For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of
D: a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no
D: need of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
D: drawer, when indeed there is no need.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Am I like such a fellow?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as
D: soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: And what to?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would
D: kill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a
D: hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel
D: with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou
D: hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
D: Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy
D: head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast
D: quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath
D: wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall
D: out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
D: another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
D: tutor me from quarrelling!
C: BENVOLIO.
D: And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee
D: simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: The fee simple! O simple!
D:  Enter Tybalt and others.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: By my head, here comes the Capulets.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: By my heel, I care not.
C: TYBALT.
D: Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
D: Gentlemen, good-deC: a word with one of you.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a
D: word and a blow.
C: TYBALT.
D: You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me
D: occasion.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Could you not take some occasion without giving?
C: TYBALT.
D: Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of
D: us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s
D: that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
C: BENVOLIO.
D: We talk here in the public haunt of men.
D: Either withdraw unto some private place,
D: And reason coldly of your grievances,
D: Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
D: I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.
D:  Enter Romeo.
C: TYBALT.
D: Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
D: Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;
D: Your worship in that sense may call him man.
C: TYBALT.
D: Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
D: No better term than this: Thou art a villain.
C: ROMEO.
D: Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
D: Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
D: To such a greeting. Villain am I none;
D: Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.
C: TYBALT.
D: Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
D: That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.
C: ROMEO.
D: I do protest I never injur’d thee,
D: But love thee better than thou canst devise
D: Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
D: And so good Capulet, which name I tender
D: As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
D: [_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.
D: Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
C: TYBALT.
D: What wouldst thou have with me?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to
D: make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest
D: of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?
D: Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.
C: TYBALT.
D: [_Drawing._] I am for you.
C: ROMEO.
D: Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Come, sir, your passado.
D:  [_They fight._]
C: ROMEO.
D: Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
D: Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,
D: Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
D: Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
D: Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
D:  [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]
C: MERCUTIO.
D: I am hurt.
D: A plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.
D: Is he gone, and hath nothing?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: What, art thou hurt?
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.
D: Where is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.
D:  [_Exit Page._]
C: ROMEO.
D: Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis
D: enough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a
D: grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both
D: your houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to
D: death. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
D: arithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your
D: arm.
C: ROMEO.
D: I thought all for the best.
C: MERCUTIO.
D: Help me into some house, Benvolio,
D: Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.
D: They have made worms’ meat of me.
D: I have it, and soundly too. Your houses!
D:  [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]
C: ROMEO.
D: This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,
D: My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
D: In my behalf; my reputation stain’d
D: With Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour
D: Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,
D: Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
D: And in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.
D:  Re-enter Benvolio.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,
D: That gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,
D: Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
C: ROMEO.
D: This day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;
D: This but begins the woe others must end.
D:  Re-enter Tybalt.
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
C: ROMEO.
D: Again in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
D: Away to heaven respective lenity,
D: And fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!
D: Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again
D: That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul
D: Is but a little way above our heads,
D: Staying for thine to keep him company.
D: Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
C: TYBALT.
D: Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
D: Shalt with him hence.
C: ROMEO.
D: This shall determine that.
D:  [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Romeo, away, be gone!
D: The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
D: Stand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death
D: If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
C: ROMEO.
D: O, I am fortune’s fool!
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Why dost thou stay?
D:  [_Exit Romeo._]
D:  Enter Citizens.
C: FIRST CITIZEN.
D: Which way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?
D: Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: There lies that Tybalt.
C: FIRST CITIZEN.
D: Up, sir, go with me.
D: I charge thee in the Prince’s name obey.
D:  Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others.
C: PRINCE.
D: Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: O noble Prince, I can discover all
D: The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
D: There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
D: That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!
D: O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d
D: Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
D: For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
D: O cousin, cousin.
C: PRINCE.
D: Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
C: BENVOLIO.
D: Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;
D: Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
D: How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal
D: Your high displeasure. All this uttered
D: With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d
D: Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
D: Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
D: With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,
D: Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
D: And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
D: Cold death aside, and with the other sends
D: It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
D: Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
D: ‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,
D: His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
D: And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
D: An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
D: Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
D: But by and by comes back to Romeo,
D: Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,
D: And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I
D: Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;
D: And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
D: This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: He is a kinsman to the Montague.
D: Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
D: Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
D: And all those twenty could but kill one life.
D: I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;
D: Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
C: PRINCE.
D: Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.
D: Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
C: MONTAGUE.
D: Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;
D: His fault concludes but what the law should end,
D: The life of Tybalt.
C: PRINCE.
D: And for that offence
D: Immediately we do exile him hence.
D: I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,
D: My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
D: But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine
D: That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
D: I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
D: Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
D: Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
D: Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
D: Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
D: Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.
D:  Enter Juliet.
C: JULIET.
D: Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
D: Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner
D: As Phaeton would whip you to the west
D: And bring in cloudy night immediately.
D: Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
D: That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo
D: Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.
D: Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
D: By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
D: It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
D: Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
D: And learn me how to lose a winning match,
D: Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
D: Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,
D: With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,
D: Think true love acted simple modesty.
D: Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;
D: For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
D: Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
D: Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,
D: Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
D: Take him and cut him out in little stars,
D: And he will make the face of heaven so fine
D: That all the world will be in love with night,
D: And pay no worship to the garish sun.
D: O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
D: But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,
D: Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day
D: As is the night before some festival
D: To an impatient child that hath new robes
D: And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,
D: And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
D: But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.
D:  Enter Nurse, with cords.
D: Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?
D: The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?
C: NURSE.
D: Ay, ay, the cords.
D:  [_Throws them down._]
C: JULIET.
D: Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
C: NURSE.
D: Ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
D: We are undone, lady, we are undone.
D: Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.
C: JULIET.
D: Can heaven be so envious?
C: NURSE.
D: Romeo can,
D: Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.
D: Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
C: JULIET.
D: What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
D: This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.
D: Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,
D: And that bare vowel I shall poison more
D: Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
D: I am not I if there be such an I;
D: Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.
D: If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.
D: Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
C: NURSE.
D: I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
D: God save the mark!—here on his manly breast.
D: A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
D: Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,
D: All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
C: JULIET.
D: O, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.
D: To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.
D: Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,
D: And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.
C: NURSE.
D: O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.
D: O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!
D: That ever I should live to see thee dead.
C: JULIET.
D: What storm is this that blows so contrary?
D: Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?
D: My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
D: Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,
D: For who is living, if those two are gone?
C: NURSE.
D: Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
D: Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.
C: JULIET.
D: O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
C: NURSE.
D: It did, it did; alas the day, it did.
C: JULIET.
D: O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
D: Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
D: Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,
D: Dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
D: Despised substance of divinest show!
D: Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
D: A damned saint, an honourable villain!
D: O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
D: When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
D: In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
D: Was ever book containing such vile matter
D: So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
D: In such a gorgeous palace.
C: NURSE.
D: There’s no trust,
D: No faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,
D: All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
D: Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
D: These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
D: Shame come to Romeo.
C: JULIET.
D: Blister’d be thy tongue
D: For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
D: Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
D: For ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d
D: Sole monarch of the universal earth.
D: O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
C: NURSE.
D: Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?
C: JULIET.
D: Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
D: Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
D: When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?
D: But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
D: That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
D: Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
D: Your tributary drops belong to woe,
D: Which you mistaking offer up to joy.
D: My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
D: And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
D: All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
D: Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
D: That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,
D: But O, it presses to my memory
D: Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.
D: Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.
D: That ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’
D: Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
D: Was woe enough, if it had ended there.
D: Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
D: And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
D: Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,
D: Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,
D: Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?
D: But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,
D: ‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word
D: Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
D: All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,
D: There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
D: In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.
D: Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?
C: NURSE.
D: Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.
D: Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
C: JULIET.
D: Wash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,
D: When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.
D: Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,
D: Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.
D: He made you for a highway to my bed,
D: But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
D: Come cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,
D: And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.
C: NURSE.
D: Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo
D: To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
D: Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
D: I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.
C: JULIET.
D: O find him, give this ring to my true knight,
D: And bid him come to take his last farewell.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s cell.
D:  Enter Friar Lawrence.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
D: Affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts
D: And thou art wedded to calamity.
D:  Enter Romeo.
C: ROMEO.
D: Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?
D: What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
D: That I yet know not?
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Too familiar
D: Is my dear son with such sour company.
D: I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
C: ROMEO.
D: What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,
D: Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.
C: ROMEO.
D: Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death;
D: For exile hath more terror in his look,
D: Much more than death. Do not say banishment.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Hence from Verona art thou banished.
D: Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
C: ROMEO.
D: There is no world without Verona walls,
D: But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
D: Hence banished is banish’d from the world,
D: And world’s exile is death. Then banished
D: Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,
D: Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,
D: And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
D: Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,
D: Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,
D: And turn’d that black word death to banishment.
D: This is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.
C: ROMEO.
D: ’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here
D: Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
D: And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
D: Live here in heaven and may look on her,
D: But Romeo may not. More validity,
D: More honourable state, more courtship lives
D: In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
D: On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,
D: And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
D: Who, even in pure and vestal modesty
D: Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.
D: But Romeo may not, he is banished.
D: This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
D: They are free men but I am banished.
D: And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
D: Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
D: No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
D: But banished to kill me? Banished?
D: O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.
D: Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,
D: Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
D: A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
D: To mangle me with that word banished?
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,
C: ROMEO.
D: O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: I’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,
D: Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
D: To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
C: ROMEO.
D: Yet banished? Hang up philosophy.
D: Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
D: Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,
D: It helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: O, then I see that mad men have no ears.
C: ROMEO.
D: How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
C: ROMEO.
D: Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
D: Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
D: An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
D: Doting like me, and like me banished,
D: Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
D: And fall upon the ground as I do now,
D: Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
D:  [_Knocking within._]
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
C: ROMEO.
D: Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans
D: Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
D:  [_Knocking._]
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,
D: Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.
D:  [_Knocking._]
D: Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,
D: What simpleness is this.—I come, I come.
D:  [_Knocking._]
D: Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?
C: NURSE.
D: [_Within._] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
D: I come from Lady Juliet.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Welcome then.
D:  Enter Nurse.
C: NURSE.
D: O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,
D: Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
C: NURSE.
D: O, he is even in my mistress’ case.
D: Just in her case! O woeful sympathy!
D: Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,
D: Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
D: Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.
D: For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
D: Why should you fall into so deep an O?
C: ROMEO.
D: Nurse.
C: NURSE.
D: Ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.
C: ROMEO.
D: Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
D: Doth not she think me an old murderer,
D: Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy
D: With blood remov’d but little from her own?
D: Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
D: My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?
C: NURSE.
D: O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
D: And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
D: And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
D: And then down falls again.
C: ROMEO.
D: As if that name,
D: Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
D: Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand
D: Murder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,
D: In what vile part of this anatomy
D: Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
D: The hateful mansion.
D:  [_Drawing his sword._]
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Hold thy desperate hand.
D: Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.
D: Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
D: The unreasonable fury of a beast.
D: Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
D: And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
D: Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,
D: I thought thy disposition better temper’d.
D: Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
D: And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,
D: By doing damned hate upon thyself?
D: Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?
D: Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet
D: In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
D: Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
D: Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,
D: And usest none in that true use indeed
D: Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
D: Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
D: Digressing from the valour of a man;
D: Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
D: Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;
D: Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
D: Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
D: Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,
D: Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
D: And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.
D: What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,
D: For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
D: There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
D: But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.
D: The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,
D: And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.
D: A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
D: Happiness courts thee in her best array;
D: But like a misshaped and sullen wench,
D: Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.
D: Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
D: Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,
D: Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
D: But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
D: For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
D: Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
D: To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
D: Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
D: With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
D: Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.
D: Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
D: And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
D: Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
D: Romeo is coming.
C: NURSE.
D: O Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night
D: To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
D: My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.
C: ROMEO.
D: Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
C: NURSE.
D: Here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
D: Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: ROMEO.
D: How well my comfort is reviv’d by this.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Go hence, good night, and here stands all your state:
D: Either be gone before the watch be set,
D: Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
D: Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,
D: And he shall signify from time to time
D: Every good hap to you that chances here.
D: Give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.
C: ROMEO.
D: But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
D: It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
D: Farewell.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE IV. A Room in Capulet’s House.
D:  Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris.
C: CAPULET.
D: Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
D: That we have had no time to move our daughter.
D: Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
D: And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
D: ’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.
D: I promise you, but for your company,
D: I would have been abed an hour ago.
C: PARIS.
D: These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
D: Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;
D: Tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.
C: CAPULET.
D: Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
D: Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
D: In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
D: Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
D: Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
D: And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,
D: But, soft, what day is this?
C: PARIS.
D: Monday, my lord.
C: CAPULET.
D: Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
D: A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,
D: She shall be married to this noble earl.
D: Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
D: We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,
D: For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
D: It may be thought we held him carelessly,
D: Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
D: Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
D: And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
C: PARIS.
D: My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.
C: CAPULET.
D: Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
D: Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
D: Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
D: Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!
D: Afore me, it is so very very late that we
D: May call it early by and by. Good night.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE V. An open Gallery to Juliet’s Chamber, overlooking the Garden.
D:  Enter Romeo and Juliet.
C: JULIET.
D: Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
D: It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
D: That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
D: Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
D: Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
C: ROMEO.
D: It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
D: No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
D: Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
D: Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
D: Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
D: I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
C: JULIET.
D: Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.
D: It is some meteor that the sun exhales
D: To be to thee this night a torchbearer
D: And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
D: Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.
C: ROMEO.
D: Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,
D: I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
D: I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,
D: ’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.
D: Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
D: The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
D: I have more care to stay than will to go.
D: Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.
D: How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.
C: JULIET.
D: It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.
D: It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
D: Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
D: Some say the lark makes sweet division;
D: This doth not so, for she divideth us.
D: Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.
D: O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,
D: Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
D: Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
D: O now be gone, more light and light it grows.
C: ROMEO.
D: More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
D:  Enter Nurse.
C: NURSE.
D: Madam.
C: JULIET.
D: Nurse?
C: NURSE.
D: Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
D: The day is broke, be wary, look about.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: JULIET.
D: Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
C: ROMEO.
D: Farewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.
D:  [_Descends._]
C: JULIET.
D: Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,
D: I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
D: For in a minute there are many days.
D: O, by this count I shall be much in years
D: Ere I again behold my Romeo.
C: ROMEO.
D: Farewell!
D: I will omit no opportunity
D: That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
C: JULIET.
D: O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?
C: ROMEO.
D: I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve
D: For sweet discourses in our time to come.
C: JULIET.
D: O God! I have an ill-divining soul!
D: Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
D: As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
D: Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.
C: ROMEO.
D: And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
D: Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.
D:  [_Exit below._]
C: JULIET.
D: O Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,
D: If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
D: That is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;
D: For then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long
D: But send him back.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: [_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?
C: JULIET.
D: Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?
D: Is she not down so late, or up so early?
D: What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?
D:  Enter Lady Capulet.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Why, how now, Juliet?
C: JULIET.
D: Madam, I am not well.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
D: What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
D: And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
D: Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,
D: But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
C: JULIET.
D: Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
D: Which you weep for.
C: JULIET.
D: Feeling so the loss,
D: I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death
D: As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.
C: JULIET.
D: What villain, madam?
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: That same villain Romeo.
C: JULIET.
D: Villain and he be many miles asunder.
D: God pardon him. I do, with all my heart.
D: And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: That is because the traitor murderer lives.
C: JULIET.
D: Ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.
D: Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
D: Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,
D: Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,
D: Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
D: That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
D: And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
C: JULIET.
D: Indeed I never shall be satisfied
D: With Romeo till I behold him—dead—
D: Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.
D: Madam, if you could find out but a man
D: To bear a poison, I would temper it,
D: That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,
D: Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
D: To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,
D: To wreak the love I bore my cousin
D: Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
D: But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
C: JULIET.
D: And joy comes well in such a needy time.
D: What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
D: One who to put thee from thy heaviness,
D: Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
D: That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.
C: JULIET.
D: Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
D: The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
D: The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,
D: Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
C: JULIET.
D: Now by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,
D: He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
D: I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
D: Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
D: I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
D: I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
D: It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
D: Rather than Paris. These are news indeed.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,
D: And see how he will take it at your hands.
D:  Enter Capulet and Nurse.
C: CAPULET.
D: When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
D: But for the sunset of my brother’s son
D: It rains downright.
D: How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
D: Evermore showering? In one little body
D: Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
D: For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
D: Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
D: Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
D: Who raging with thy tears and they with them,
D: Without a sudden calm will overset
D: Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
D: Have you deliver’d to her our decree?
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
D: I would the fool were married to her grave.
C: CAPULET.
D: Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.
D: How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
D: Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
D: Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
D: So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
C: JULIET.
D: Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
D: Proud can I never be of what I hate;
D: But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
C: CAPULET.
D: How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?
D: Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;
D: And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,
D: Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
D: But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next
D: To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,
D: Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
D: Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!
D: You tallow-face!
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Fie, fie! What, are you mad?
C: JULIET.
D: Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
D: Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
C: CAPULET.
D: Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!
D: I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,
D: Or never after look me in the face.
D: Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.
D: My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
D: That God had lent us but this only child;
D: But now I see this one is one too much,
D: And that we have a curse in having her.
D: Out on her, hilding.
C: NURSE.
D: God in heaven bless her.
D: You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
C: CAPULET.
D: And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,
D: Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
C: NURSE.
D: I speak no treason.
C: CAPULET.
D: O God ye good-en!
C: NURSE.
D: May not one speak?
C: CAPULET.
D: Peace, you mumbling fool!
D: Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,
D: For here we need it not.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: You are too hot.
C: CAPULET.
D: God’s bread, it makes me mad!
D: Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,
D: Alone, in company, still my care hath been
D: To have her match’d, and having now provided
D: A gentleman of noble parentage,
D: Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,
D: Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,
D: Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,
D: And then to have a wretched puling fool,
D: A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,
D: To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,
D: I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’
D: But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.
D: Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
D: Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.
D: Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.
D: And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;
D: And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
D: For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,
D: Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
D: Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: JULIET.
D: Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
D: That sees into the bottom of my grief?
D: O sweet my mother, cast me not away,
D: Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
D: Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
D: In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.
D: Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: JULIET.
D: O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?
D: My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
D: How shall that faith return again to earth,
D: Unless that husband send it me from heaven
D: By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
D: Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
D: Upon so soft a subject as myself.
D: What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
D: Some comfort, Nurse.
C: NURSE.
D: Faith, here it is.
D: Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing
D: That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.
D: Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
D: Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
D: I think it best you married with the County.
D: O, he’s a lovely gentleman.
D: Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
D: Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
D: As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
D: I think you are happy in this second match,
D: For it excels your first: or if it did not,
D: Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,
D: As living here and you no use of him.
C: JULIET.
D: Speakest thou from thy heart?
C: NURSE.
D: And from my soul too,
D: Or else beshrew them both.
C: JULIET.
D: Amen.
C: NURSE.
D: What?
C: JULIET.
D: Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
D: Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
D: Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,
D: To make confession and to be absolv’d.
C: NURSE.
D: Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: JULIET.
D: Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
D: Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
D: Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
D: Which she hath prais’d him with above compare
D: So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.
D: Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
D: I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.
D: If all else fail, myself have power to die.
D:  [_Exit._]
M: ACT IV
M: SCENE I. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
D:  Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
C: PARIS.
D: My father Capulet will have it so;
D: And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
D: Uneven is the course; I like it not.
C: PARIS.
D: Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,
D: And therefore have I little talk’d of love;
D: For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
D: Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
D: That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
D: And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
D: To stop the inundation of her tears,
D: Which, too much minded by herself alone,
D: May be put from her by society.
D: Now do you know the reason of this haste.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: [_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—
D: Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
D:  Enter Juliet.
C: PARIS.
D: Happily met, my lady and my wife!
C: JULIET.
D: That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
C: PARIS.
D: That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.
C: JULIET.
D: What must be shall be.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: That’s a certain text.
C: PARIS.
D: Come you to make confession to this father?
C: JULIET.
D: To answer that, I should confess to you.
C: PARIS.
D: Do not deny to him that you love me.
C: JULIET.
D: I will confess to you that I love him.
C: PARIS.
D: So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
C: JULIET.
D: If I do so, it will be of more price,
D: Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
C: PARIS.
D: Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.
C: JULIET.
D: The tears have got small victory by that;
D: For it was bad enough before their spite.
C: PARIS.
D: Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.
C: JULIET.
D: That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
D: And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
C: PARIS.
D: Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.
C: JULIET.
D: It may be so, for it is not mine own.
D: Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
D: Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—
D: My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
C: PARIS.
D: God shield I should disturb devotion!—
D: Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,
D: Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: JULIET.
D: O shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
D: Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: O Juliet, I already know thy grief;
D: It strains me past the compass of my wits.
D: I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
D: On Thursday next be married to this County.
C: JULIET.
D: Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,
D: Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
D: If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
D: Do thou but call my resolution wise,
D: And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
D: God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;
D: And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,
D: Shall be the label to another deed,
D: Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
D: Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
D: Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,
D: Give me some present counsel, or behold
D: ’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
D: Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
D: Which the commission of thy years and art
D: Could to no issue of true honour bring.
D: Be not so long to speak. I long to die,
D: If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
D: Which craves as desperate an execution
D: As that is desperate which we would prevent.
D: If, rather than to marry County Paris
D: Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
D: Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
D: A thing like death to chide away this shame,
D: That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.
D: And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.
C: JULIET.
D: O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
D: From off the battlements of yonder tower,
D: Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
D: Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;
D: Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,
D: O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
D: With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
D: Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
D: And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
D: Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
D: And I will do it without fear or doubt,
D: To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent
D: To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;
D: Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,
D: Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
D: Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
D: And this distilled liquor drink thou off,
D: When presently through all thy veins shall run
D: A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
D: Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
D: No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,
D: The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
D: To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,
D: Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
D: Each part depriv’d of supple government,
D: Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.
D: And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death
D: Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
D: And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
D: Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
D: To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
D: Then as the manner of our country is,
D: In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,
D: Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
D: Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
D: In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
D: Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
D: And hither shall he come, and he and I
D: Will watch thy waking, and that very night
D: Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
D: And this shall free thee from this present shame,
D: If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
D: Abate thy valour in the acting it.
C: JULIET.
D: Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear!
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
D: In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed
D: To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
C: JULIET.
D: Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.
D: Farewell, dear father.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE II. Hall in Capulet’s House.
D:  Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse and Servants.
C: CAPULET.
D: So many guests invite as here are writ.
D:  [_Exit first Servant._]
D: Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
C: SECOND SERVANT.
D: You shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can lick their
D: fingers.
C: CAPULET.
D: How canst thou try them so?
C: SECOND SERVANT.
D: Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;
D: therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
C: CAPULET.
D: Go, begone.
D:  [_Exit second Servant._]
D: We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.
D: What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
C: NURSE.
D: Ay, forsooth.
C: CAPULET.
D: Well, he may chance to do some good on her.
D: A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.
D:  Enter Juliet.
C: NURSE.
D: See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
C: CAPULET.
D: How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?
C: JULIET.
D: Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
D: Of disobedient opposition
D: To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d
D: By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
D: To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.
D: Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.
C: CAPULET.
D: Send for the County, go tell him of this.
D: I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.
C: JULIET.
D: I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,
D: And gave him what becomed love I might,
D: Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.
C: CAPULET.
D: Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.
D: This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.
D: Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.
D: Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar,
D: All our whole city is much bound to him.
C: JULIET.
D: Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
D: To help me sort such needful ornaments
D: As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
C: CAPULET.
D: Go, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.
D:  [_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._]
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: We shall be short in our provision,
D: ’Tis now near night.
C: CAPULET.
D: Tush, I will stir about,
D: And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
D: Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
D: I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.
D: I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho!—
D: They are all forth: well, I will walk myself
D: To County Paris, to prepare him up
D: Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light
D: Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE III. Juliet’s Chamber.
D:  Enter Juliet and Nurse.
C: JULIET.
D: Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,
D: I pray thee leave me to myself tonight;
D: For I have need of many orisons
D: To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
D: Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.
D:  Enter Lady Capulet.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
C: JULIET.
D: No, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries
D: As are behoveful for our state tomorrow.
D: So please you, let me now be left alone,
D: And let the nurse this night sit up with you,
D: For I am sure you have your hands full all
D: In this so sudden business.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Good night.
D: Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
D:  [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]
C: JULIET.
D: Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
D: I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
D: That almost freezes up the heat of life.
D: I’ll call them back again to comfort me.
D: Nurse!—What should she do here?
D: My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
D: Come, vial.
D: What if this mixture do not work at all?
D: Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
D: No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
D:  [_Laying down her dagger._]
D: What if it be a poison, which the Friar
D: Subtly hath minister’d to have me dead,
D: Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,
D: Because he married me before to Romeo?
D: I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
D: For he hath still been tried a holy man.
D: How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
D: I wake before the time that Romeo
D: Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!
D: Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
D: To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
D: And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
D: Or, if I live, is it not very like,
D: The horrible conceit of death and night,
D: Together with the terror of the place,
D: As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
D: Where for this many hundred years the bones
D: Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,
D: Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
D: Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
D: At some hours in the night spirits resort—
D: Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
D: So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
D: And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
D: That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.
D: O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
D: Environed with all these hideous fears,
D: And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?
D: And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
D: And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
D: As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
D: O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost
D: Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
D: Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
D: Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.
D:  [_Throws herself on the bed._]
M: SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet’s House.
D:  Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse.
C: NURSE.
D: They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
D:  Enter Capulet.
C: CAPULET.
D: Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow’d,
D: The curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.
D: Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelica;
D: Spare not for cost.
C: NURSE.
D: Go, you cot-quean, go,
D: Get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow
D: For this night’s watching.
C: CAPULET.
D: No, not a whit. What! I have watch’d ere now
D: All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
D: But I will watch you from such watching now.
D:  [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]
C: CAPULET.
D: A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!
D:  Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets.
D: Now, fellow, what’s there?
C: FIRST SERVANT.
D: Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
C: CAPULET.
D: Make haste, make haste.
D:  [_Exit First Servant._]
D: —Sirrah, fetch drier logs.
D: Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
C: SECOND SERVANT.
D: I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
D: And never trouble Peter for the matter.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: CAPULET.
D: Mass and well said; a merry whoreson, ha.
D: Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.
D: The County will be here with music straight,
D: For so he said he would. I hear him near.
D:  [_Play music._]
D: Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, Nurse, I say!
D:  Re-enter Nurse.
D: Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up.
D: I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
D: Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already.
D: Make haste I say.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE V. Juliet’s Chamber; Juliet on the bed.
D:  Enter Nurse.
C: NURSE.
D: Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
D: Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed!
D: Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!
D: What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now.
D: Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
D: The County Paris hath set up his rest
D: That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
D: Marry and amen. How sound is she asleep!
D: I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
D: Ay, let the County take you in your bed,
D: He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?
D: What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?
D: I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady!
D: Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!
D: O, well-a-day that ever I was born.
D: Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! My lady!
D:  Enter Lady Capulet.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: What noise is here?
C: NURSE.
D: O lamentable day!
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: What is the matter?
C: NURSE.
D: Look, look! O heavy day!
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: O me, O me! My child, my only life.
D: Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.
D: Help, help! Call help.
D:  Enter Capulet.
C: CAPULET.
D: For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come.
C: NURSE.
D: She’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead; alack the day!
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!
C: CAPULET.
D: Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,
D: Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff.
D: Life and these lips have long been separated.
D: Death lies on her like an untimely frost
D: Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
C: NURSE.
D: O lamentable day!
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: O woful time!
C: CAPULET.
D: Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
D: Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
D:  Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
C: CAPULET.
D: Ready to go, but never to return.
D: O son, the night before thy wedding day
D: Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,
D: Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
D: Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
D: My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
D: And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.
C: PARIS.
D: Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,
D: And doth it give me such a sight as this?
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: Accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.
D: Most miserable hour that e’er time saw
D: In lasting labour of his pilgrimage.
D: But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
D: But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
D: And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.
C: NURSE.
D: O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day.
D: Most lamentable day, most woeful day
D: That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
D: O day, O day, O day, O hateful day.
D: Never was seen so black a day as this.
D: O woeful day, O woeful day.
C: PARIS.
D: Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.
D: Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,
D: By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.
D: O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!
C: CAPULET.
D: Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.
D: Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now
D: To murder, murder our solemnity?
D: O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,
D: Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,
D: And with my child my joys are buried.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Peace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not
D: In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
D: Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,
D: And all the better is it for the maid.
D: Your part in her you could not keep from death,
D: But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
D: The most you sought was her promotion,
D: For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,
D: And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d
D: Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
D: O, in this love, you love your child so ill
D: That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
D: She’s not well married that lives married long,
D: But she’s best married that dies married young.
D: Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
D: On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
D: And in her best array bear her to church;
D: For though fond nature bids us all lament,
D: Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.
C: CAPULET.
D: All things that we ordained festival
D: Turn from their office to black funeral:
D: Our instruments to melancholy bells,
D: Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
D: Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
D: Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
D: And all things change them to the contrary.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
D: And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare
D: To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
D: The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
D: Move them no more by crossing their high will.
D:  [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
C: NURSE.
D: Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
D: For well you know this is a pitiful case.
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
D:  [_Exit Nurse._]
D:  Enter Peter.
C: PETER.
D: Musicians, O, musicians, ‘Heart’s ease,’ ‘Heart’s ease’, O, and you
D: will have me live, play ‘Heart’s ease.’
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: Why ‘Heart’s ease’?
C: PETER.
D: O musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is full’. O play
D: me some merry dump to comfort me.
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.
C: PETER.
D: You will not then?
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: No.
C: PETER.
D: I will then give it you soundly.
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: What will you give us?
C: PETER.
D: No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: Then will I give you the serving-creature.
C: PETER.
D: Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will
D: carry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: And you re us and fa us, you note us.
C: SECOND MUSICIAN.
D: Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
C: PETER.
D: Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and
D: put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
D:     ‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,
D:       And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
D:     Then music with her silver sound’—
D: Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,
D: Simon Catling?
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
C: PETER.
D: Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
C: SECOND MUSICIAN.
D: I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.
C: PETER.
D: Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?
C: THIRD MUSICIAN.
D: Faith, I know not what to say.
C: PETER.
D: O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is
D: ‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for
D: sounding.
D:       ‘Then music with her silver sound
D:       With speedy help doth lend redress.’
D:  [_Exit._]
C: FIRST MUSICIAN.
D: What a pestilent knave is this same!
C: SECOND MUSICIAN.
D: Hang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay
D: dinner.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: ACT V
M: SCENE I. Mantua. A Street.
D:  Enter Romeo.
C: ROMEO.
D: If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
D: My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
D: My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;
D: And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit
D: Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
D: I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—
D: Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—
D: And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,
D: That I reviv’d, and was an emperor.
D: Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,
D: When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.
D:  Enter Balthasar.
D: News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
D: Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
D: How doth my lady? Is my father well?
D: How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
D: For nothing can be ill if she be well.
C: BALTHASAR.
D: Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
D: Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,
D: And her immortal part with angels lives.
D: I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,
D: And presently took post to tell it you.
D: O pardon me for bringing these ill news,
D: Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
C: ROMEO.
D: Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!
D: Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,
D: And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
C: BALTHASAR.
D: I do beseech you sir, have patience.
D: Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
D: Some misadventure.
C: ROMEO.
D: Tush, thou art deceiv’d.
D: Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
D: Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
C: BALTHASAR.
D: No, my good lord.
C: ROMEO.
D: No matter. Get thee gone,
D: And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.
D:  [_Exit Balthasar._]
D: Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
D: Let’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift
D: To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
D: I do remember an apothecary,—
D: And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted
D: In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,
D: Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,
D: Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
D: And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
D: An alligator stuff’d, and other skins
D: Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
D: A beggarly account of empty boxes,
D: Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
D: Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
D: Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.
D: Noting this penury, to myself I said,
D: And if a man did need a poison now,
D: Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
D: Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
D: O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
D: And this same needy man must sell it me.
D: As I remember, this should be the house.
D: Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.
D: What, ho! Apothecary!
D:  Enter Apothecary.
C: APOTHECARY.
D: Who calls so loud?
C: ROMEO.
D: Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
D: Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
D: A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
D: As will disperse itself through all the veins,
D: That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
D: And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath
D: As violently as hasty powder fir’d
D: Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.
C: APOTHECARY.
D: Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law
D: Is death to any he that utters them.
C: ROMEO.
D: Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
D: And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
D: Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
D: Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.
D: The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;
D: The world affords no law to make thee rich;
D: Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
C: APOTHECARY.
D: My poverty, but not my will consents.
C: ROMEO.
D: I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
C: APOTHECARY.
D: Put this in any liquid thing you will
D: And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
D: Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.
C: ROMEO.
D: There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,
D: Doing more murder in this loathsome world
D: Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
D: I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
D: Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
D: Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
D: To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
M: SCENE II. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
D:  Enter Friar John.
C: FRIAR JOHN.
D: Holy Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!
D:  Enter Friar Lawrence.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: This same should be the voice of Friar John.
D: Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
D: Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
C: FRIAR JOHN.
D: Going to find a barefoot brother out,
D: One of our order, to associate me,
D: Here in this city visiting the sick,
D: And finding him, the searchers of the town,
D: Suspecting that we both were in a house
D: Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
D: Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,
D: So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Who bare my letter then to Romeo?
C: FRIAR JOHN.
D: I could not send it,—here it is again,—
D: Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
D: So fearful were they of infection.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
D: The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
D: Of dear import, and the neglecting it
D: May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
D: Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
D: Unto my cell.
C: FRIAR JOHN.
D: Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Now must I to the monument alone.
D: Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
D: She will beshrew me much that Romeo
D: Hath had no notice of these accidents;
D: But I will write again to Mantua,
D: And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
D: Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.
D:  [_Exit._]
M: SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.
D:  Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.
C: PARIS.
D: Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.
D: Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
D: Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
D: Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;
D: So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
D: Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
D: But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
D: As signal that thou hear’st something approach.
D: Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
C: PAGE.
D: [_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone
D: Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
D:  [_Retires._]
C: PARIS.
D: Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.
D: O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,
D: Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
D: Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.
D: The obsequies that I for thee will keep,
D: Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
D:  [_The Page whistles._]
D: The boy gives warning something doth approach.
D: What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
D: To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
D: What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.
D:  [_Retires._]
D:  Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.
C: ROMEO.
D: Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
D: Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
D: See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
D: Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,
D: Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof
D: And do not interrupt me in my course.
D: Why I descend into this bed of death
D: Is partly to behold my lady’s face,
D: But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
D: A precious ring, a ring that I must use
D: In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
D: But if thou jealous dost return to pry
D: In what I further shall intend to do,
D: By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,
D: And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
D: The time and my intents are savage-wild;
D: More fierce and more inexorable far
D: Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
C: BALTHASAR.
D: I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
C: ROMEO.
D: So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
D: Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.
C: BALTHASAR.
D: For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.
D: His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
D:  [_Retires_]
C: ROMEO.
D: Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
D: Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,
D: Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
D:  [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]
D: And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.
C: PARIS.
D: This is that banish’d haughty Montague
D: That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,
D: It is supposed, the fair creature died,—
D: And here is come to do some villainous shame
D: To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
D:  [_Advances._]
D: Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague.
D: Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death?
D: Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
D: Obey, and go with me, for thou must die.
C: ROMEO.
D: I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
D: Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
D: Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
D: Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
D: Put not another sin upon my head
D: By urging me to fury. O be gone.
D: By heaven I love thee better than myself;
D: For I come hither arm’d against myself.
D: Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,
D: A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.
C: PARIS.
D: I do defy thy conjuration,
D: And apprehend thee for a felon here.
C: ROMEO.
D: Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
D:  [_They fight._]
C: PAGE.
D: O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
D:  [_Exit._]
C: PARIS.
D: O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,
D: Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
D:  [_Dies._]
C: ROMEO.
D: In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
D: Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!
D: What said my man, when my betossed soul
D: Did not attend him as we rode? I think
D: He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
D: Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
D: Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
D: To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
D: One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.
D: I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
D: A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,
D: For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
D: This vault a feasting presence full of light.
D: Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.
D:  [_Laying Paris in the monument._]
D: How oft when men are at the point of death
D: Have they been merry! Which their keepers call
D: A lightning before death. O, how may I
D: Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,
D: Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
D: Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
D: Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet
D: Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
D: And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
D: Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
D: O, what more favour can I do to thee
D: Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
D: To sunder his that was thine enemy?
D: Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,
D: Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
D: That unsubstantial death is amorous;
D: And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
D: Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
D: For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
D: And never from this palace of dim night
D: Depart again. Here, here will I remain
D: With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
D: Will I set up my everlasting rest;
D: And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
D: From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.
D: Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you
D: The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
D: A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
D: Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.
D: Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
D: The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.
D: Here’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!
D: Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
D:  [_Dies._]
D:  Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a
D:  lantern, crow, and spade.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight
D: Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?
D: Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?
C: BALTHASAR.
D: Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
D: What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
D: To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
D: It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
C: BALTHASAR.
D: It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,
D: One that you love.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Who is it?
C: BALTHASAR.
D: Romeo.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: How long hath he been there?
C: BALTHASAR.
D: Full half an hour.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Go with me to the vault.
C: BALTHASAR.
D: I dare not, sir;
D: My master knows not but I am gone hence,
D: And fearfully did menace me with death
D: If I did stay to look on his intents.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
D: O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
C: BALTHASAR.
D: As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
D: I dreamt my master and another fought,
D: And that my master slew him.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: Romeo! [_Advances._]
D: Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
D: The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
D: What mean these masterless and gory swords
D: To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?
D:  [_Enters the monument._]
D: Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
D: And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour
D: Is guilty of this lamentable chance?
D: The lady stirs.
D:  [_Juliet wakes and stirs._]
C: JULIET.
D: O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?
D: I do remember well where I should be,
D: And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
D:  [_Noise within._]
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
D: Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
D: A greater power than we can contradict
D: Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
D: Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
D: And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee
D: Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
D: Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
D: Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
C: JULIET.
D: Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
D:  [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]
D: What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
D: Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
D: O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop
D: To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
D: Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
D: To make me die with a restorative.
D:  [_Kisses him._]
D: Thy lips are warm!
C: FIRST WATCH.
D: [_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?
C: JULIET.
D: Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger.
D:  [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]
D: This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die.
D:  [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]
D:  Enter Watch with the Page of Paris.
C: PAGE.
D: This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
C: FIRST WATCH.
D: The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
D: Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.
D:  [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]
D: Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,
D: And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
D: Who here hath lain this two days buried.
D: Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.
D: Raise up the Montagues, some others search.
D:  [_Exeunt others of the Watch._]
D: We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
D: But the true ground of all these piteous woes
D: We cannot without circumstance descry.
D:  Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.
C: SECOND WATCH.
D: Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.
C: FIRST WATCH.
D: Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
D:  Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.
D: THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
D: We took this mattock and this spade from him
D: As he was coming from this churchyard side.
C: FIRST WATCH.
D: A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.
D:  Enter the Prince and Attendants.
C: PRINCE.
D: What misadventure is so early up,
D: That calls our person from our morning’s rest?
D:  Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.
C: CAPULET.
D: What should it be that they so shriek abroad?
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: O the people in the street cry Romeo,
D: Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run
D: With open outcry toward our monument.
C: PRINCE.
D: What fear is this which startles in our ears?
C: FIRST WATCH.
D: Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
D: And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
D: Warm and new kill’d.
C: PRINCE.
D: Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
C: FIRST WATCH.
D: Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,
D: With instruments upon them fit to open
D: These dead men’s tombs.
C: CAPULET.
D: O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
D: This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house
D: Is empty on the back of Montague,
D: And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.
C: LADY CAPULET.
D: O me! This sight of death is as a bell
D: That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
D:  Enter Montague and others.
C: PRINCE.
D: Come, Montague, for thou art early up,
D: To see thy son and heir more early down.
C: MONTAGUE.
D: Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
D: Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.
D: What further woe conspires against mine age?
C: PRINCE.
D: Look, and thou shalt see.
C: MONTAGUE.
D: O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
D: To press before thy father to a grave?
C: PRINCE.
D: Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
D: Till we can clear these ambiguities,
D: And know their spring, their head, their true descent,
D: And then will I be general of your woes,
D: And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
D: And let mischance be slave to patience.
D: Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: I am the greatest, able to do least,
D: Yet most suspected, as the time and place
D: Doth make against me, of this direful murder.
D: And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
D: Myself condemned and myself excus’d.
C: PRINCE.
D: Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
C: FRIAR LAWRENCE.
D: I will be brief, for my short date of breath
D: Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
D: Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
D: And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.
D: I married them; and their stol’n marriage day
D: Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
D: Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;
D: For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.
D: You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
D: Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce
D: To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
D: And with wild looks, bid me devise some means
D: To rid her from this second marriage,
D: Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
D: Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
D: A sleeping potion, which so took effect
D: As I intended, for it wrought on her
D: The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
D: That he should hither come as this dire night
D: To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,
D: Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
D: But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
D: Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight
D: Return’d my letter back. Then all alone
D: At the prefixed hour of her waking
D: Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,
D: Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
D: Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
D: But when I came, some minute ere the time
D: Of her awaking, here untimely lay
D: The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
D: She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
D: And bear this work of heaven with patience.
D: But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
D: And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
D: But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
D: All this I know; and to the marriage
D: Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this
D: Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
D: Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,
D: Unto the rigour of severest law.
C: PRINCE.
D: We still have known thee for a holy man.
D: Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?
C: BALTHASAR.
D: I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,
D: And then in post he came from Mantua
D: To this same place, to this same monument.
D: This letter he early bid me give his father,
D: And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,
D: If I departed not, and left him there.
C: PRINCE.
D: Give me the letter, I will look on it.
D: Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?
D: Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
C: PAGE.
D: He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
D: And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
D: Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
D: And by and by my master drew on him,
D: And then I ran away to call the watch.
C: PRINCE.
D: This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,
D: Their course of love, the tidings of her death.
D: And here he writes that he did buy a poison
D: Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal
D: Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
D: Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,
D: See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
D: That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
D: And I, for winking at your discords too,
D: Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.
C: CAPULET.
D: O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
D: This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
D: Can I demand.
C: MONTAGUE.
D: But I can give thee more,
D: For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
D: That whiles Verona by that name is known,
D: There shall no figure at such rate be set
D: As that of true and faithful Juliet.
C: CAPULET.
D: As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
D: Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
C: PRINCE.
D: A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
D: The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
D: Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.
D: Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,
D: For never was a story of more woe
D: Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
D:  [_Exeunt._]
