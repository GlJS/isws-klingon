C: ACT I
D: SCENE ONE
C: 5:00 P.M. The Street.
D: A suggestion of city streets and alleyways: a brick wall.
N: The opening is musical: half-danced, half-mimed, with occasional phrases of dialogue. It is primarily a condensation of the growing rivalry between two teen-age games, the Jets and the Sharks, each of which has its own prideful uniform. The boys - sideburned, long-haired- are vital, restless, sardonic; the Sharks are Puerto Ricans, the Jets an anthology of what is called "American." The action begins with the Jets in possession of the are: owning, enjoying, loving their "home." Their leader is Riff: glowing, driving, intelligent, slightly wacky. His lieutenant is Deisel: big, slow, steady, nice. The youngest member of the gang is Baby John: awed at everything including that he is a Jet, trying to act the big man. His buddy is A-rab: an explosive little ferret who enjoys everything and understands the seriousness of nothing. The most aggressive is Action: a catlike ball of fury. We will get to know these boys better later, as well as Snowboy: a bespectacled self-styled expert. The first interruption of the Jets' sunny mood is the sharply punctuated entrance of the leader of the Sharks, Bernardo: handsome proud, fluid, a chip on his sardonic shoulder. The Jets, by far in the majority, flick him off. He returns with other Sharks: they, too, are flicked off. But the numerical supremacy, the strength of the Jets, is gradually being threatened. The beginnings of warfare are mild at first: a boy being tripped up, or being sandbagged with a flour sack or even being spit on -all with overly elaborate apologies. Finally, A-rab comes across the suddenly deserted area, pretending to be an airplane. There is no sound as he zooms along in fancied flight. Then over the wall drops Bernardo. Another Shark, another and another appear, blocking A-rab's panicky efforts at escape. They close in, grab him, pummel him, as a Shark on top of the wall is stationed as lookout. Finally, Bernardo bends over A-rab and makes a gesture (piercing his ear); the lookout whistles; Jets tear on, Sharks tear on, and a free- for-all breaks out. Riff goes at once to A-rab, like a protective father. The fight is stopped by a police whistle, louder and louder, and the arrival of a big goonlike cop, Krupke, and a plainclothesman, Schrank. Schrank is strong, always in command; he has a charming, pleasant manner, which he often employs to cover his venom and his fear.
C: KRUPKE
D: Knock it off! Settle down.
C: SCHRANK
D: All right: Kill each other! ...But not on my beat.
C: RIFF [such innocence]
D: Why if it isn't Lieutenant Schrank.
N: SEVERAL JETS [dancing class manners] To of the day, Lieutenant Schrank.
C: BERNARDO [one with Riff]
D: And Officer Krupke!
C: SEVERAL SHARKS
D: Top of the day, Officer Krupke.
C: SCHRANK
D: Boy, what you Puerto Ricans have done to this neighborhood. Which one of 'em clobbered ya, A-rab? [A-rab looks to Riff, who takes over with great helpful seriousness.]
C: RIFF
D: As a matter of factuality, sir, we suspicion the job was done by a cop.
C: SNOWBOY
D: Two cops.
C: A-RAB
D: Oh, at least!
C: KRUPKE
D: Impossible!
C: SCHRANK
D: Didn't nobody tell ya there's a difference between bein' a stool pigeon and cooperatin' with the law?
C: RIFF
D: You told us the difference, sir. And we all chipped in for a prize for the first guy who can figure it out.
C: ACTION [indicating Schrank]
D: Maybe buddy boy should get the prize.
C: SCHRANK
D: Don't buddy me, Action! I got a hot surprise for you: you hoodlums don't own the streets. There's been too much raiding between you and the PRs. All right, Bernardo, get your trash outa here. [Mock Charm.] Please.
C: BERNARDO
D: Let's go, Sharks. [They exit.]
C: SCHRANK [to Jets]
D: If I don't put down the roughhouse, I get put down -on a traffic corner. Your friends don't like traffic corners. So you buddy boys are gonna play ball with me. I gotta put up with them and so do you. You're gonna make nice with them PRs from now on. Because otherwise I'm gonna beat the crap outa every one of ya and then run ya in. Say good-bye to the nice boys, Krupke.
N: KRUPKE Good-bye, boys. [He follows Schrank out.]
C: SNOWBOY [imitating Krupke]
D: Good-bye, boys.
C: A-RAB
D: They make a very nice couple.
C: ACTION [bitterly]
D: You hoodlums don't own the streets.
C: SNOWBOY
D: Go play in the park!
C: ACTION
D: Keep off the grass!
C: BABY JOHN
D: Get outa the house!
C: ACTION
D: Keep off the block!
C: A-RAB
D: Get outa here!
C: ACTION
D: Keep off the world! A gang that down own a street is nuthin'!
C: RIFF
D: WE DO OWN IT! Jets -square off! Acemen: [Diesel, Action and Snowboy line up at attention] Rocketmen: [three others line up] Rank-and-file: [Sheepishly, A-rab trudges into position, Baby John behind him.]
N: BABY JOHN [shocked, to A-rab] Gee, your ear's got blood on it!
C: A-RAB [proudly]
D: I'm a casual, Baby John.
N: BABY JOHN [examining the ear] Them PRs! They branded you!
C: SNOWBOY
D: That makes you a Puerto Rican tomato. Cha-cha-cha, se√±orita?
C: RIFF
D: Cut the frabbajabba. Which one of the Sharks did it?
C: A-RAB
D: Bernardo. 'Cause I heard him say: "Thees ees for stink-bombin' my old man's store." [He makes the same gesture Bernardo made when he pierced his ear.]
C: BABY JOHN
D: Ouch!
C: ACTION
D: You shoulda done worse. Them PRs're the reason my old man's gone bust.
C: RIFF
D: Who says?
C: ACTION
D: My old man says.
C: BABY JOHN [to A-rab]
D: My old man says his old man woulda gone bust anyway.
C: ACTION
D: Your old man says that?
C: BABY JOHN
D: My old man says them Puerto Ricans is ruinin' free ennaprise.
C: ACTION
D: And what're we doin' about it? [Pushing through the game comes a scrawny teen-age girl, dressed in an outfit that is a pathetic attempt to imitate that of the Jets. Perhaps we have glimpsed her in the fracas before the police am e in. Her name is Anybodys.]
C: ANYBODYS
D: Gassin', crabbin'-
C: ACTION
D: You still around?
C: ANYBODYS
D: Listen I was a smash in that fight. Oh, Riff, Riff, I was murder!
C: RIFF
D: Come on, Anybodys-
C: ANYBODYS
D: Riff, how about me getting' in the gang now?
C: A-RAB
D: How about the gang gettin' in -ahhh, who'd wanta!
C: ANYBODYS
D: You cheap beast! [She lunges for A-rab, but Riff pulls her off and pushes her out.]
C: RIFF
D: The road, little lady, the road. [In a moment of bravado, just before she goes, Anybodys spits-but cautiously.] Round out! [This is Riff's summoning of the gang, and they surround him.] We fought hard for this territory and it's ours. But with those cops servin' as cover, the PRs can move in right under our noses and
N: take it away. Unless we speed fast and clean 'em up in one all- out fight!
C: ACTION [eagerly]
D: A rumble! [A jabbing gesture.] Chung! Chung!
C: RIFF
D: Cool, Action boy. The Sharks want a place, too, and they are tough. They might ask for bottles of knives or zip guns.
C: BABY JOHN
D: Zip guys... Gee!
C: RIFF
D: I'm not finalizin' and sayin' they will: I'm only sayin' they might and we gotta be prepared. Now what's your mood?
C: ACTION
D: I say go, go!!
C: SNOWBOY
D: But if they say knives or guns-
C: BABY JOHN
D: I say let's forget the whole thing.
C: DIESEL
D: What do you say, Riff?
C: RIFF
D: I say this turf is small, but it's all we got. I wanna hold it like we always held it: with skin! But if they say switchblades, I'll get a switchblade. I say I want the Jets to be Number One, to sail, to hold the sky!
C: DIESEL
D: Then rev us off. [A punching gesture.] Voom-va voom!
C: ACTION
D: Chung chung!
C: A-RAB
D: Cracko, jacko!
C: SNOWBOY
D: Riga diga dum!
C: BABY JOHN
D: Pam pam!!
C: RIFF
D: OK, buddy boys, we rumble! [General glee.] Now protocality calls for a war council to decide on weapons. I'll make the challenge to Bernardo.
C: SNOWBOY
D: You gotta take a lieutenant.
C: ACTION
D: That's me!
C: RIFF
D: That's Tony.
C: ACTION
D: Who need Tony? Music starts.
C: RIFF
D: Against the Sharks we need every man we got.
C: ACTION
D: Tony don't belong any more.
C: RIFF
D: Cut it, Action boy. I and Tony started the Jets.
C: ACTION
D: Well, he acts like he don't wanna belong.
C: BABY JOHN
D: Who wouldn't wanna belong to the Jets!
C: ACTION
D: Tony ain't been with us for over a month.
C: SNOWBOY
D: What about the day we clobbered the Emeralds?
C: A-RAB
D: Which we couldn't have done without Tony.
C: BABY JOHN
D: He saved my ever lovin' neck.
C: RIFF
D: Right. He's always come through for us and he will now. [He sings:] When you're a Jet, You're a Jet all the way From your first cigarette To your last dyin' day. When you're a Jet, If the spit hits the fan, You got brothers around, You're a family man! You're never alone, You're never disconnected! You're home with your own: When company's expected, You're well protected! Then you are set
C: With a capital J,
D: Which you'll never forget
N: Till they cart you away. When you're a Jet, You stay
C: A Jet!
D: [He speaks:] I know Tony like I know. I guarantee you can count him in.
C: ACTION
D: In, out, let's get crackin'.
C: A-RAB
D: Where you gonna find Bernardo?
C: RIFF
D: At the dance tonight at the gym.
C: BIG DEAL
D: But the gym's neutral territory.
C: RIFF [sweet innocence]
D: I'm gonna make nice there! I'm only gonna challenge him.
C: RIFF
D: Great, Daddy-O!
C: A-RAB
D: So everybody dress up sweet and sharp. Meet Tony and me at them. And walk tall! [He runs off.]
C: A-RAB
D: We always talk tall!
C: BABY JOHN
D: We're Jets!
C: ACTION
D: The greatest! [He sings with Baby John:] When you're a Jet, You're the top cat in town, You're the gold-metal kid With the heavyweight crown! [A-rab, Action, Big Deal sings:] When you're a Jet, You're the swingin'est thing. Little boy, you're a man; Little man, you're a king!
N: [All:] The Jets are in gear, Our cylinders are clickin'! The Sharks'll steer clear 'Cause ev'ry Puerto Rican 'S a lousy chicken! Here come the Jets Like a bat out of hell- Someone gets in our way, Someone don't feel so well. Here come the Jets: Little world, step aside! Better go underground, Better run, better hide. We're drawin' the line, So keep your noses hidden! We're hangin' a sign, Says "Visitors forbidden"- And we ain't kiddin'! Here come the Jets, Yeah! An' we're gonna beat Ev'ry last buggin' gang On the whole buggin' street! [Diesel and Action.] On the whole [All:] Ever-! Mother-! Lovin'-! Street! The Lights Black Out SCENE TWO. 5:30 P.M. A back yard. On a small ladder, a good-looking sandy-haired boy is painting a vertical sign that will say: "Doc's." Below, Riff is haranguing.
C: RIFF
D: Riga tiga tum tum. Why not? ...You can't say ya won't, Tony boy, without sayin' why not?
C: RIFF
D: Because it's me askin': Riff. Womb to tomb!
C: TONY
D: Sperm to worm! [Surveying the sign.] You sure this looks like skywritin'?
C: RIFF
D: It's brilliant.
C: TONY
D: Twenty-seven years the boss has had that drugstore. I wanna surprise him with a new sign.
C: RIFF [shaking the ladder.]
D: Tony, this is important!
C: TONY
D: Very important: Acemen, Rocketmen.
C: RIFF
D: What's with you? Four and one-half year I live with a buddy and his family. Four and one-half years I think I know a man's character. Buddy boy, I am a victim of disappointment in you.
C: TONY
D: End your sufferin', little man. Why don't you pack up your gear and clear out?
C: RIFF
D: 'Cause your ma's hot for me. [Tony grabs his arms and twists it.] No! 'Cause I hate livin' with my buggin' uncle uncle UNCLE! [Tony releases him and climbs back up the ladder.]
C: TONY
D: Now go play nice with the Jets.
C: RIFF
D: The Jets are the greatest!
C: TONY
D: Were.
C: RIFF
D: Are. You found something' better?
C: TONY
D: No, But-
C: RIFF
D: But what?
C: TONY
D: You won't dig it.
C: RIFF
D: Try me.
C: TONY
D: OK... Every single damn night for the last month, I wake up-and I'm reachin' out.
C: RIFF
D: For what?
C: TONY
D: I don't know. It's right outside the door, around the corner. But it's comin'!
C: RIFF
D: What is? Tell me!
N: TONY I don't know! It's-like the kick I use to get from bein' a Jet.
C: RIFF [quietly]
D: ...Or from bein buddies.
C: TONY
D: We're still buddies.
C: RIFF
D: The kick comes from the people, buddy boy.
C: TONY
D: Yea, but not from a Jet.
C: RIFF
D: No? Without a gang you're an orphan. With a gang you walk in two's three's four's. And when your gang is the best, when you're a Jet, buddy boy, you're out in the sun and home free home!
C: TONY
D: Riff, I've had it. [Pause.]
C: RIFF
D: Tony, the trouble is large: The Sharks bite hard! We got to stop them now, and we need you! [Pause. Quietly.] I never asked the time of a day from a clock, but I'm askin' you: Come to the dance tonight... [Tony turns away.] ...I already told the gang you'd be there.
N: TONY [after a moment, turns to him with a grin] What time?
C: RIFF
D: Ten?
C: TONY
D: Ten it is.
C: RIFF
D: Womb to tomb!
C: TONY
D: Sperm to worm! And I'll live to regret this.
C: RIFF
D: Who knows? Maybe what you're waitin' for'll be twitchin' at the dance! [He runs off.]
C: TONY
D: Who knows? [Music starts and he sings:] Could be!... Who knows?... There's something due any day; I will know right away, Soon as it shows.
N: It may come cannon-balling down thru the sky, Gleam in its eye, Bright as a rose! Who knows?... It's only just out of reach, Down the block, on a beach, Under a tree... I got a feeling there's a miracle due, Gonna come true, Coming to me! Could it be? Yes it could. Something's coming, something good,
C: If I can wait!
D: Something's coming, I don't know what it is, But it is Gonna be great!
N: With a click, with a shock, Phone'll jingle, door'll knock, Open the latch! Something's coming, don't know when but it's soon- Catch the moon, One-handed catch! Around the corner, Or whistling down the river, Come on-deliver To me! Will it be? Yes, it will. Maybe just by holding still, It'll be there! Come on something, come on in, don't be shy, Meet a guy, Pull up a chair! The air is humming, And something great is coming! Who knows? It's only just out of reach, Down the block, on a beach... Maybe tonight... The Lights Dim SCENE THREE. 6:00 P.M. A bridal shop. A small section, enough to include a table with sewing machine, a chair or two. Anita, A Puerto Rican girl with loose hair and slightly flashy clothes, is finishing remaking what was a white communion dress into a party dress for an extremely lovely, extremely young girl: Maria. Anita is knowing, a sexual, sharp. Maria is an excited, enthusiastic, obedient child, with the temper, stubborn strength and awareness of a woman.
C: MARIA [holding out scissors]
D: Por favor, Anita. Make the neck lower!
C: ANITA
D: Stop it, Maria.
C: MARIA
D: One inch. How much can one little inch do?
C: ANITA
D: Too much.
C: MARIA [exasperated]
D: Anita, it is now to be a dress of dancing, no longer for kneeling in front of an altar.
C: ANITA
D: With those boys you can start in dancing and end up kneeling.
C: MARIA
D: Querida, one little inch; uno poca poca-
C: ANITA
D: Bernardo made me promise-
C: MARIA
D: Ai! Bernardo! One month have I been in this country-do I ever even touch excitement? I sew all day, I sit all night. For what did my fine brother bring me here?
C: ANITA
D: To marry Chino.
C: MARIA
D: When I look at Chino, nothing happens.
C: ANITA
D: What do you expect to happen?
C: MARIA
D: I don't know: something. What happens when you look at Bernardo?
C: ANITA
D: It's when I don't look at him that it happens.
C: MARIA
D: I think I will tell Mama and Papa about you and 'Nardo in the balcony of the movies.
C: ANITA
D: I will rip this to shreds!
C: MARIA
D: No. But you perhaps could manage to lower the neck-
C: ANITA
D: Next year.
C: MARIA
D: Next year I will be married an no one will care if its down to here!
C: ANITA
D: Down to where?
C: MARIA
D: Down to here. [Indicates her waist.] I hate this dress!
C: ANITA
D: Then don't wear it and don't come to the dance.
C: MARIA [shocked]
D: Don't come! [Grabs the dress.] Could we not dye it red, at least?
C: ANITA
D: No, we could not. [She starts to help Maria into the dress.]
C: MARIA
D: White is for babies. I will be the only one there in a white-
C: ANITA
D: Well???
C: MARIA
D: Ahhhh-s√≠! It is a beautiful dress: I love you! [As she hugs Anita, Bernardo enters, followed by a shy, gentle sweet-faced boy: Chino.]
C: BERNARDO
D: Are you ready?
C: MARIA
D: Come in, 'Nardo. [Whirls in the dress.] Is it not beautiful?
N: BERNARDO [looking only at Maria's face] Yes. [Kisses her.] Very.
C: ANITA
D: I didn't quite hear...
N: BERNARDO [kissin Anita quite differently.] Very beautiful.
C: MARIA
D: [watches them a second, then turns to Chino] Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.
C: CHINO
D: But this is a shop for ladies.
C: BERNARDO
D: Our ladies!
C: MARIA
D: 'Nardo, it is most important that I have a wonderful time at the dancing tonight.
N: BENARDO [as Anita hooks up Maria] Why?
C: MARIA
D: Because tonight is the real beginning of my life as a young lady of America! [She begins to whirl in the dress as the shop slides off and a flood of gaily colored streamers pours down. As Maria begins to turn and turn, going off-stage. Sharks girls, dressed for the dance whirl on, followed by Jet girls. By boys from both gangs. The streamers fly up again for the next scene.]
N: SCENE FOUR.
C: 10:00 P.M. The gym.
D: Actually, a converted gymnasium of a settlement house, at the moment being used as a dancehall, disguised for the occasion with streamers and bunting. Both gangs are jitterbugging wildly with their bodies, but their faces, although they are enjoying themselves, remain cool, almost detached. The line between the two gangs is sharply defined by the colors they wear: the Jets, girls as well as boys, reflecting the colors of the Jets jackets; the same is true of the Sharks. The dancing is a physical and emotional release for these kids. Maria enters with Chino, Bernardo and Anita. As she looks around, delighted, thrilled by this, her first dance, the Jets catch sight of Bernardo, who is being greeted by Pepe, his lieutenant, and other Sharks. As the music peters away, the Jets withdraw to one side of the hall, around Riff. The Sharks, seeing this, draw to their side, around Bernardo, who starts-with his lieutenants-to meet him. The moment is brief but it would be disastrous if a smiling, overly cheerful young man of about thirty did not hurry forward. He is called Glad Hand, and he is a "square."
C: GLAD HAND [beaming]
D: All right, boys and girls! Attention, please! [Hum of talk.] Attention! [Krupke appears behind Glad Hand: the talk stops.] Thank you. It sure is fine turnout tonight. [Ad libs from the kids.] We want to make friends here, so we're going to have a few get-together dances. [Ad libs: "Oh, ginger peachy," ect.] You form two circles: boys on the outside and girls on the inside.
C: SNOWBOY
D: Where are you?
N: GLAD HAND [tries to laugh at this] All right. Now when the music stops, each boy dances with whichever girl is opposite. O.K.? O.K. Two circles, kids. [The kids clap their hands back at him and ad lib: "Two circles, kids," ect., but do not move.] Well, it won't hurt you to try.
C: SNOWBOY [limping forward]
D: Oh, it hurts; it hurts; it- [Krupke steps forward. Snowboy straightens up and meekly returns to his place. Riff steps forward and beckons to his girl, Velma. She is terribly young, sexy, lost in a world of jive. She slithers forward to take her place with Riff. The challenge is met by Bernardo, who steps forward, leading Anita as though he were presenting the most magnificent lady in all the world. The other kids follow, forming the two circles Glad Hand requested.]
C: GLAD HAND
D: That's it, kids. Keep the ball rolling. Round she goes and where she stops, nobody knows. All right: here we go! [Promenade music starts and the circles start revolving. Glad Hand, whistles to this mouth, is in the center with Krupke. He blows the whistle and the music stops, leaving the Jet boys opposite Sharks girls, and vice versa. There is a moment of tenseness, then Bernardo reaches across the Jet girl opposite for Anita's hand, and she comes to him. Riff reaches for Velma; and the kids of both gangs follow suit. The "get-together" has failed, and each gang is on its own side of the hall as a mambo starts. This turns into a challenge dance between Bernardo and Anita-cheered on by the Sharks-and Riff and Velma-cheered on by the Jets. During it, Tony enters and is momentarily embraced by Riff, who is delighted that his best friend did turn up. The dance builds wilder and wilder, until, at the peak, everybody is dancing and shouting. "Go, Mambo!" It is at this moment that Tony and Maria-at opposite sides of the hall-see each other. They have been cheering on their respective friends, clapping in rhythm. Now, as they s
C: TONY
D: You're not thinking I'm someone else?
C: MARIA
D: I know you are not.
C: TONY
D: Or that we have met before?
C: MARIA
D: I know we have not.
C: TONY
D: I felt, I knew something-never-before was going to happen, had to happen. But this is-
C: MARIA [interrupting]
D: My hands are cold. [He takes them in his.] Yours, too. [He moves her hand to his face.] So warm. [She moves his hands to her face.]
C: TONY
D: Yours, too.
C: MARIA
D: But of course. They are the same.
C: TONY
D: It's so much to believe-you're not joking me?
C: MARIA
D: I have not yet learned how to joke that way. I think now I never will. [Impulsively, he stops to kiss her hands; then tenderly, innocently, her lips. The music bursts out, the lights flare up, and Bernardo is upon them in an icy rage.]
C: BERNARDO
D: Go home, "American."
C: TONY
D: Slow down, Bernardo.
C: BERNARDO
D: Stay away from my sister!
C: TONY
D: ...Sister? [Riff steps up.]
C: BERNARDO [to Maria]
D: Couldn't you see he's one of them?
C: MARIA
D: No; I saw only him.
N: BERNARDO [as Chino comes up] I told you; there's one thing they want from a Puerto Rican girl!
C: TONY
D: That's a lie!
C: RIFF
D: Cool, boy.
N: Chino [to Tony] Get away.
C: TONY
D: You keep out, Chino. [To Maria:] Don't listen to them!
C: BERNARDO
D: She will listen to brother before-
C: RIFF [overlapping]
D: If you characters want to settle-
C: GLAD HAND
D: Please! Everything was going so well! Do you fellows get pleasure out of making trouble? Now come on-it won't hurt you to have a
N: good time. [Music starts again. Bernardo is on one side with Maria and Chino; Anita joins them. Tony is on the other with Riff and Diesel. Light emphasizes the first group.]
C: BERNARDO
D: I warned you-
C: CHINO
D: Do not yell at her, 'Nardo.
C: BERNARDO
D: You yell at babies.
C: ANITA
D: And put ideas in the baby's head.
C: BERNARDO
D: Take her home, Chino.
C: MARIA
D: 'Nardo, it is my first dance.
C: BERNARDO
D: Please. We are family, Maria. Go. [Maria hesitates, then starts out with Chino as the light follows her to the other group, which she passes.]
N: RIFF [to Diesel, indicating Tony happily] I guess the kid's with us for sure now. [Tony doesn't even hear; he is starting at Maria, who stops for a moment.]
C: CHINO
D: Come, Maria. [They continue out.]
C: TONY
D: Maria... [He is unaware that Bernardo is crossing toward him, but Riff intercepts.]
C: BERNARDO
D: I don't want you.
C: RIFF
D: I want you, though. For a war council-Jets and Sharks.
C: BERNARDO
D: The pleasure is all mine.
C: RIFF
D: Let's go outside.
C: BERNARDO
D: I would not leave the ladies here alone. We will meet you in half an hour.
C: RIFF
D: Doc's drugstore? [Bernardo nods.] And no jazz before then.
C: BERNARDO
D: I understand the rules-Native Boy. [The lights is fading on them, on everyone but Tony.]
C: RIFF
D: Spread the word, Diesel.
C: DIESEL
D: Right, Daddy-o.
C: RIFF
D: Let's get the chicks and kick it. Tony?
C: TONY
D: Maria... [Music stars.]
C: RIFF [in darkness]
D: Tony!
C: DIESEL [in darkness]
D: Ah, we'll see him at Doc's.
N: TONY [speaking dreamily over the music-he is now standing alone in the light] The most beautiful sound I ever heard.
C: VOICES [off stage:]
D: Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria...
C: TONY
D: All the beautiful words of the world in a single word:
C: VOICES [off stage:]
D: Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria... [Swelling in intensity.]
C: TONY
D: Maria! I've just met a girl named Maria, And suddenly that name Will never be the same To me.
N: Maria! I've just kissed a girl named Maria, And suddenly I've found How wonderful a sound Can be! Maria! Say it loud and there's music playing- Say it soft and it's almost like praying- Maria... I'll never stop saying Maria! The most beautiful sound I ever heard. Maria CHORUS [offstage, against Tony's obbligato:] I've just met a girl named Maria, And suddenly that name Will never be the same To me. Maria- I've just kissed a girl named Maria, And suddenly I've found How wonderful a sound Can be!
C: TONY
D: Maria- Say it loud and there's music playing- Say it soft and it's almost like praying- Maria- I'll never stop saying Maria! The most beautiful sound I ever heard- Maria. [During the song, the sate behind Tony has gone dark; by the time he has finished, it is set for the next scene.]
N: SCENE FIVE. 11:00 P.M. A back alley. A suggestion of buildings; a fire escape climbing to the rear window of an unseen flat. As Tony sings, he looks for where Maria lives, wishing for her. And she does appear, at the window above him, which opens onto the fire escape. Music stays beneath most of the scene.
C: TONY [sings:]
D: Maria, Maria...
C: MARIA
D: Ssh!
C: TONY
D: Maria!
C: MARIA
D: Quiet!
C: TONY
D: Come down.
C: MARIA
D: No.
C: TONY
D: Maria...
C: MARIA
D: Please. If Bernardo-
C: TONY
D: He's at the dance. Come down.
C: MARIA
D: He will soon bring Anita home.
C: TONY
D: Just for a minute.
C: MARIA [smiles]
D: A minute is not enough.
C: TONY [smiles]
D: For an hour then.
C: MARIA
D: I cannot.
C: TONY
D: Forever!
C: MARIA
D: Ssh!
C: TONY
D: Then I'm coming up.
N: WOMAN'S VOICE [from the offstage apartment] Maria!
C: MARIA
D: Momentito, Mama...
C: TONY [climbing up]
D: Maria, Maria-
C: MARIA
D: C√°llate! [Reaching her hand out to stop him.] Ssh!
C: TONY [grabbing her hand]
D: Ssh!
C: MARIA
D: It is dangerous.
C: TONY
D: I'm not "one of them."
C: MARIA
D: You are; but to me, you are not. Just as I am one of them-[she
N: gestures toward the apartment.]
C: TONY
D: To me, you are all the- [She covers his mouth with her hand.]
N: MAN'S VOICE [from the unseen apartment] Maruca!
C: MARIA
D: S√≠, ya vengo, Papa.
C: TONY
D: Maruca?
C: MARIA
D: His pet name for me.
C: TONY
D: I like him. He will like me.
C: MARIA
D: No. He is like Bernardo: afraid. [Suddenly laughing.] Imagine being afraid of you!
C: TONY
D: You see?
C: MARIA [touching his face]
D: I see you.
C: TONY
D: See only me.
C: MARIA [sings:]
D: Only you, you're the only thing I'll see forever. In my eyes, in my words and in everything I do, Nothing else but you Ever!
C: TONY
D: And there's nothing for me but Maria, Every sight that I see is Maria.
C: MARIA
D: Tony, Tony...
C: TONY
D: Always you , every thought I'll ever know, Everywhere I go, you'll be.
C: MARIA
D: All the world is only you and me! [And now the buildings, the world fade away, leaving them suspended in space.] Tonight, tonight, It all began tonight,
N: I saw you and the world went away. Tonight, tonight, There's only you tonight, What you are, what you do, what you say.
C: TONY
D: Today, all day I had the feeling
C: A miracle would happen-
D: I know now I was right. For here you are And what was just a world is a star Tonight!
C: BOTH
D: Tonight, tonight, The world is full of light, With suns and moons all over the place. Tonight, tonight, The world is wild and bright, Going mad, shooting stars into space. Today the world was just an address, A place for me to live in, No better than all right, But here you are And what was just a world is a star Tonight!
C: MAN'S VOICE [offstage]
D: Maruca!
C: MARIA
D: Wait for me! [She goes inside as the buildings begin to come back into place.]
C: TONY [sings]
D: Tonight, tonight, It all began tonight, I saw you and the world went away.
C: MARIA [returning]
D: I cannot stay. Go quickly!
C: TONY
D: I'm not afraid.
C: MARIA
D: They are strict with me. Please.
C: TONY [kissing her]
D: Good night.
C: MARIA
D: Buenos noches.
C: TONY
D: I love you.
C: MARIA
D: Yes, yes. Hurry. [He climbs down.] Wait! When will I see you? [He starts back up.] No!
C: TONY
D: Tomorrow.
C: MARIA
D: I work at the bridal shop. Come there.
C: TONY
D: At sundown.
C: MARIA
D: Yes. Good night.
C: TONY
D: Good night. [He starts off.]
C: MARIA
D: Tony!
C: TONY
D: Ssh!
C: MARIA
D: Come to the back door.
C: TONY
D: Si. [Again he starts out.]
C: MARIA
D: Tony! [He stops. A pause.] What does Tony stand for?
C: TONY
D: Anton.
C: MARIA
D: Te adoro, Anton.
C: TONY
D: Te adoro, Maria. [Both sing as music starts again:] Good night, good night, Sleep well and when you dream, Dream of me Tonight. [She goes inside; He ducks out into the shadows just as Bernardo and Anita enter, followed by Indio, and Pep and their girls. One is a bleached-blond, bangled beauty: Consuelo. The other, more quietly dressed, is Rosalia. She is not too bright.]
N: BERNARDO [Looking up to the window.] Maria?
C: ANITA
D: She also has a mother. Also a father.
C: BERNARDO
D: They do not know the country any better than she does.
C: ANITA
D: You do not know it all! Girls here are free to have fun. She-is- in-America-now.
C: BERNARDO [exaggerated]
D: But Puerto-Rico-is-in-America-now!
C: ANITA [in disgust]
D: Ai!
C: BERNARDO [cooing]
D: Anita Josefina Teresita-
C: ANITA
D: It's plain Anita now-
C: BERNARDO [continuing through]
D: -Beatriz del Carmen Margarita, etcetera, etcetera-
C: ANITA
D: Immigrant!
N: BERNARDO [pulling her to him] Thank God, you can't change your hair! PEPE [fondling Consuelo's bleached mop] Is that possible?
C: CONSUELO
D: In the U.S.A., everything is real.
N: BERNARDO [to Chino, who enters] Chino, how was she when you took her home?
C: CHINO
D: All right. 'Nardo, she was only dancing.
C: BERNARDO
D: With an "American." Who is really a Polack.
C: ANITA
D: Says the Spic.
C: BERNARDO
D: You are not so cute.
C: ANITA
D: That Tony is.
C: ROSALIA
D: And he works.
N: CHINO A delivery boy.
C: ANITA
D: And what are you?
C: CHINO
D: An assistant.
C: BERNARDO
D: S√≠! And Chino makes half what the Polack makes-the Polack is American! [A burlesque oration in mock Puerto Rican accent. Bernardo starts the first line with her.] The mother of Tony was born in Poland; the father still goes to a night school. Tony was born in America, so that makes him an American. But us? Foreigners!
C: PEPE and CONSUELO
D: Lice!
C: PEPE, CONSUELO, ANITA
D: Cockroaches!
C: BERNARDO
D: Well, it is true! You remember how we were when we first came! Did we even think of going back?
C: BERNARDO and ANITA
D: No! We came ready, eager-
C: ANITA [mocking]
D: With our hearts open-
C: CONSUELO
D: Our arms open-
C: PEPE
D: You came with your pants open.
C: CONSUELO
D: You did, pig! [Slaps him.] You'll go back with handcuffs!
C: BERNARDO
D: I am going back with a Cadillac!
C: CHINO
D: Air-conditioned!
C: BERNARDO
D: Built-in bar!
C: CHINO
D: Telephone!
C: BERNARDO
D: Television!
N: CHINO Compatible color!
C: BERNARDO
D: And a king-sized bed. [Grabs Anita.] Come on.
C: ANITA [mimicking]
D: Come on.
C: BERNARDO
D: Well, are you or aren't you?
C: ANITA
D: You have your big, important war council. The council or me?
C: BERNARDO
D: First one, then the other.
N: ANITA [breaking away from him] I am an American girl now. I don't wait.
C: BERNARDO [to Chino]
D: Back home, women know their place.
C: ANITA
D: Back home, little boys don't have war councils.
C: BERNARDO
D: You want me to be an American? [To the boys.] V√°monos, chicos, Es tarde. [A mock bow.] Buenos noches, Anita Josefina del Carmen, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. [He exits with the boys.]
C: ROSALIA
D: That's a very pretty name: Etcetera.
C: ANITA
D: Ai!
C: CONSUELO
D: She means well.
C: ROSALIA
D: We have many names at home.
C: ANITA [mimicking]
D: At home, at home. If it's so nice "at home," why don't you go back there?
C: ROSALIA
D: I would like-[A look from Anita.]-just for a successful visit. [She sings nostalgically:] Puerto Rico... You lovely island... Island of tropical breezes. Always the pineapples growing, Always the coffee blossoms blowing...
C: ANITA
D: Puerto Rico... You ugly island... Island of tropic diseases. Always the hurricanes blowing, Always the population growing... And the money owing, And the babies crying, And the bullets flying. I like the island Manhattan- Smoke on your pipe and put that in! [all, except Rosalia:] I like to be in America! OK by me in America! Everything free in America For a small fee in America!
C: ROSALIA
D: I like the city of San Juan-
C: ANITA
D: I know a boat you can get on.
C: ROSALIA
D: Hundreds of flowers in full bloom-
C: ANITA
D: Hundreds of people in each room! [all except Rosalia:] Automobile in America, Chromium steel in America, Wire-spoke wheel in America- Very big deal in America-
C: ROSALIA
D: I'll drive a Buick to San Juan-
C: ANITA
D: If there's a road you can drive on.
C: ROSALIA
D: I'll give my cousin a free ride-
C: ANITA
D: How you get all of them inside? [all except Rosalia:] An immigrant goes to America, Many hellos in America; Nobody knows in America Puerto Rico's in America. [The girls whistle and dace.]
C: ROSALIA
D: When will I go back to San Juan-
C: ANITA
D: When you will shut up and get gone!
C: ROSALIA
D: I'll give them new washing machine-
C: ANITA
D: What have they got there to keep clean? [all except Rosalia:] I like the shores of America! Comfort is yours in America! Knobs on the doors in America, Wall-to-wall floors in America! [They whistle and dance.]
C: ROSALIA
D: I'll bring TV to San Juan
C: ANITA
D: If there's a current to turn on.
C: ROSALIA
D: Everyone there will get big cheer!
C: ANITA
D: Everyone there will have moved here! [The song ends in a joyous dance.] The Lights Black Out.
N: SCENE SIX. Midnight. The drugstore. A suggestion of a run-down, musty general store which, in cities, is called a drugstore. A door leading to the street outside; another leading to the cellar below. Baby John is reading a comic book; A-rab is playing solitaire; Anybodys is huddled by the jukebox: Action is watching the street door. The atmosphere is tense, jumpy. Action slams the door and strides to the dart board.
C: ACTION
D: Where the devil are they? Are we havin' a war council tonight or ain't we? [He throws a dart savagely.]
C: BABY JOHN
D: He don't use knives. He don't even use an atomic ray gun.
C: A-RAB
D: Superman. Gee, I love him.
C: SNOWBOY
D: So marry him.
C: ANYBODYS
D: I ain't never gonna get married: too noisy.
C: A-RAB
D: You ain't never gonna get married: too ugly.
C: ANYBODYS ["shooting" him]
D: Pow pow!
C: A-RAB
D: Cracko, jacko! [Clutching his belly, he spins to the floor.] Down goes a teen-age hoodlum.
C: BABY JOHN
D: Could a zip gun make you do like that? [A second of silence. Then Snowboy slams into the room and they all jump.]
C: ACTION
D: What the hell's a matter with you?
C: SNOWBOY
D: I got caught sneakin' outa the movies.
C: A-RAB
D: Sneakin' out? Whadd'ya do that for?
C: SNOWBOY
D: I sneaked in.
C: ACTION
D: A ware council comin' up and he goes to the movies.
C: ANYBODYS
D: And you let him be a Jet!
C: BABY JOHN
D: Ah, go walk the streets like ya sister.
C: ANYBODYS [jumping him]
D: Lissen, jail bait, I licked you twice and I can do it again. [From the doorway behind the counter a little middle-aged man enters: Doc.]
C: DOC
D: Curfew, gentlemen. And lady. Baby John, you should be home in bed.
C: BABY JOHN
D: We're gonna have a ware council here, Doc.
C: DOC
D: A who?
C: A-RAB
D: To decide on weapons for a big-time rumble!
C: SNOWBOY
D: We're gonna mix with the PRs.
C: DOC
D: Weapons. You couldn't play basketball?
C: ANYBODYS
D: Get with it, buddy boy.
C: DOC
D: War councils-
C: ACTION
D: Don't start, Doc.
C: DOC
D: Rumbles...
C: ACTION
D: Doc-
C: DOC
D: Why, when I was your age-
C: ACTION
D: When you was my age; when my old man was my age; when my brother was my age! You was never my age, none a you! The sooner you creeps get a hip to that, the sooner you'll dig us.
C: DOC
D: I'll dig you early graves, that's what I'll do.
C: A-RAB
D: Dig, dig, dig-
C: DOC
D: What're you gonna be when you grow up?
C: ANYBODYS [wistfully.] A telephone call girl!
D: [The store doorbell tinkles as Riff enters with Velma.]
C: SNOWBOY
D: Riff, hey!
C: ACTION
D: Are they comin'?
C: RIFF
D: Unwind, Action. Hey, Doc, Tony here?
C: DOC
D: No, Riff, it's closing time.
C: ACTION [to Riff]
D: What d'ya think they're gonna ask for?
C: A-RAB
D: Just rubber hoses, maybe, huh?
C: RIFF
D: Cool, little men. Easy, freezy cool.
C: VELMA
D: Oo, oo, ooblee-oo. [Diesel enters with a would-be grand number: Graziella.]
C: DIESEL
D: They're comin' any minute now!
C: ACTION
D: Chung chung!
C: A-RAB
D: Cracko, jacko!
C: VELMA
D: Ooblee-oo.
C: RIFF [sharply]
D: Cool!
C: ANYBODYS
D: Riff-in a tight spot you need every man you-
C: RIFF
D: No.
N: GRAZIELLA [indicating Anybodys to Velma] An American tragedy.
C: ANYBODYS ["shooting" to her]
D: Pow.
C: GRAZIELLA
D: Poo.
C: VELMA
D: Ooblee-pooh. [They giggle.]
C: RIFF
D: Now when the victims come in, you chicks cut out.
C: GRAZIELLA
D: We might, and then again, we might not.
C: DIESEL
D: This ain't kid stuff, Graziella.
C: GRAZIELLA
D: I and Velma aint kid stuff, neither. Are we, Vel?
C: VELMA
D: No thank you-oo, ooblee-oo.
N: GRAZIELLA And you can punctuate it?
C: VELMA
D: Ooo! [They giggle again.]
C: ACTION [to Riff]
D: What're we poppin' around with dumb broads?
C: GRAZIELLA
D: I and Velma ain't dumb!
C: ACTION
D: We got important business comin'
C: DOC
D: Makin' trouble for the Puerto Ricans?
C: SNOWBOY
D: They make trouble for us.
C: DOC
D: Look! He almost laughs when he says it. For you, trouble is a relief.
C: RIFF
D: We've got to stand up to the PRs, Doc. It's important.
C: DOC
D: Fighting over a little piece of the street is so important?
C: ACTION
D: To us, it is.
C: DOC
D: To hoodlums, it is. [He goes out through the cellar doorway as Action lunges for him.]
C: ACTION
D: Don't you call me hoodlum!
C: RIFF [holding him]
D: Easy, Action! Save your steam for the rumble.
C: A-RAB
D: He don't want what we want, so we're hoodlums!
C: BABY JOHN
D: I wear a jacket like my buddies, so my teacher calls me hoodlum!
C: ACTION
D: I swear, the next creep who calls me hoodlum-
C: RIFF
D: You'll laugh! Yeah. Now you all better dig this and dig it the most. No matter who or what is eatin' at you, you show it, buddy boys, and you are dead. You are cuttin' a hole in yourselves for
N: them to stick in a red-hot umbrella and open it. Wide. You wanna live? You play it cool. [Music starts.]
C: ACTION
D: I wanna get even!
C: RIFF
D: Get cool.
C: A-RAB
D: I wanna bust!
C: RIFF
D: Bust cool.
C: RIFF
D: Go cool! Boy, boy, crazy boy- Get cool, boy! Got a rocket in your pocket- Keep coolly cool, boy! Don't get hot, 'Cause, man, you got Some high times ahead. Take it slow and, Daddy-o, You can live it up and die in bed! Boy, boy, crazy boy- Stay loose, boy! Breeze it, buzz it, easy does it- Turn off the juice, boy! Go man, go, But not like a yo Yo school boy- Just play it cool, boy. Real cool! Easy, Action. Easy. [This leads into a frenetic dance in which the boys and girls release their emotions and get "cool." It finishes, starts again when a Jet bounces in with the gang whistle. Everyone but Riff and Velma stops dancing. A moment, then Bernardo, Chino, Pepe and Indio enter. The tinkle of the doorbell brings a moment longer. Then he pats Velma on her behind. Followed by Graziella, she runs out, slithering past the Sharks. Anybodys is back, huddled by the jukebox, but Riff spots her. He gives him a pleading let-me-stay look, but he gestures for her to go. Unlike the other girls, as she exits, Anybodys shoves the Sharks like a big tough man.]
C: RIFF
D: Set 'em up, Doc. Cokes all around.
C: BERNARDO
D: Let's get down to business.
C: RIFF
D: Bernardo hasn't learned the procedures of gracious livin'.
C: BERNARDO
D: I don't like you, either. So cut it.
C: RIFF
D: Kick it, Doc.
C: DOC
D: Boys, couldn't you maybe all talk it-
C: RIFF
D: Kick it! [Do goes out. The two gangs take places behind their leaders.]
C: RIFF
D: We challenge you to a rumble. All out, once and for all. Accept?
C: BERNARDO
D: On what terms?
C: RIFF
D: Whatever terms you're callin', buddy boy. You crossed the line once too often.
C: BERNARDO
D: You started it.
C: RIFF
D: Who jumped A-rab this afternoon?
C: BERNARDO
D: Who jumped me the first day I moved here?
C: RIFF
D: Who asked you to moved here?
C: BERNARDO
D: Who asked you?
C: SNOWBOY
D: Move where you're wanted!
C: A-RAB
D: Back where ya came from!
C: ACTION
D: Spics!
C: PEPE
D: Micks!
C: INDIO
D: Wop!
C: BERNARDO
D: We accept!
C: RIFF
D: Time:
C: BERNARDO
D: Tomorrow?
C: RIFF
D: The river.
C: BERNARDO
D: Under the highway. [They shake.]
C: RIFF
D: Weapons!
C: BERNARDO
D: Weapons...
C: RIFF
D: You call.
C: BERNARDO
D: You're challenge.
C: RIFF
D: Afraid to call?
C: BERNARDO
D: ...Sticks.
C: RIFF
D: ...Rocks.
C: BERNARDO
D: ...Poles.
C: RIFF
D: ...Cans.
C: BERNARDO
D: ...Bricks.
C: RIFF
D: ...Bats.
C: BERNARDO
D: ...Clubs.
C: TONY
D: Bottles, knives, guns! [They stare.] What a coop full of chickens!
C: BERNARDO
D: Every dog knows his own.
C: TONY
D: I'm callin' all of you chicken. The big touch buddy boys have to throw bricks! Afraid to get close in? Afraid to slug it out? Afraid to use plain skin?
C: BABY JOHN
D: Not even garbage?
C: ACTION
D: That ain't ruble.
C: RIFF
D: Who says?
C: BERNARDO
D: You said call weapons.
C: TONY
D: A rumble can be clinched by a fair fight. If you have the guts to risk that. Best man from each gang to slug it out.
C: BERNARDO [looking at Tony]
D: I'd enjoy to risk that. O.K.! Fair fight!
C: PEPE
D: What?
C: ACTION [simultaneously]
D: No!
C: RIFF
D: The commanders say yes or no. [To Bernardo.] Fair fight. [They shake.]
C: BERNARDO [To Tony.]
D: In two minutes you will be like a fish after skinnin'.
C: RIFF
D: Your best man fights our best man-and we pick him. [Claps Diesel on the shoulder.]
C: BERNARDO
D: But I thought it would be-
C: RIFF
D: We shook on it, Bernardo.
C: BERNARDO
D: Yes. I shook on it.
C: ACTION [quickly]
D: Look, Bernardo, if you wanna change your mind, maybe we could all- [One of the Jets near the door suddenly whistles. Instantly, they shift positions so they are mixed up, no segregation. Silence; then in comes Schrank. During the following, the gangs are absolutely silent and motionless, unless otherwise indicated.]
N: Good evening, Lieutenant Schrank. I and Tony was just closing up. SCHRANK [lifting a pack of cigarettes] Mind?
C: DOC
D: I have no mind. I am the village idiot.
C: SCHRANK [lighting a cigarette]
D: I always make it a rule to smoke in the can. And what else is a room with half-breeds in it, eh, Riff? [Bernardo's move is checked by Riff. Schrank speaks again, pleasantly.] Clear out, Spics. Sure; it's a free country and I ain't got the right. But it's a country with laws: and I can find the right. I got the badge, you got the skin. It's tough all over. Beat it! [A second. Then Riff nods once to Bernardo, who nods to his gang. Slowly, they file out. Bernardo starts to whistle "My Country 'Tis of Thee" as he exits proudly. His gang joins in, finishing a sardonic jazz lick offstage. Schrank, still pleasant.] From their angle, sure. Say, where's the rumble gonna be? Ah, look: I know regular American don't rub with the gold=teeth otherwise. The river? The park? [Silence.] I'm for you. I want this beat cleaned up and you can do it for me. I'll even lend a hand if it gets rough. Where ya gonna rumble? The playground? Sweeney's lot? [Angered by the silence.] Ya think I'm a lousy stool pigeon? I wanna help ya get r [He exits.]
C: DOC [indicating Schrank]
D: Wouldn't give me a mouth like his.
C: TONY
D: Forget him. From here on in, everything goes my way. [He starts to clean up, to turn out the lights.]
C: DOC
D: You think it'll really be a fair fight.
C: TONY
D: Yeah.
C: DOC
D: What have you been takin' tonight?
C: TONY
D: A trip to the moon. And I'll tell you a secret. It isn't a man that's up there, Doc. It's a girl, a lady. [Opens the door.] Buenos noches, se√±or.
C: DOC
D: Buenos noches?! So that's why you made it a fair fight. [Tony smiles.] ...Tony... things aren't tough enough?
C: TONY
D: Tough? Doc, I'm in love.
N: DOC How do you know?
C: TONY
D: Because... there isn't any other way I could feel.
C: DOC
D: And you're not frightened?
C: TONY Should I be?
D: [He opens door, exits.]
C: DOC
D: Why? I'm frightened enough for both of you. [He turns out the last light.] The Stage is Dark.
N: SCENE SEVEN. 5:30 P.M. The next day. The bridal shop. Hot late-afternoon sun coloring the workroom. One or two sewing machines. Several dressmaker dummies, male and female, in bridal-party garb. Maria in a smock is hand-sewing a wedding veil as Anita whirls in whipping off her smock.
C: ANITA
D: She's gone! The old bag of a bruja has gone!
C: MARIA
D: Bravo!
C: ANITA
D: The day is over, the jail is open, home we go!
C: MARIA
D: You go, querida. I will lock up.
C: ANITA
D: Finish tomorrow. Come!
C: MARIA
D: I am in no hurry.
C: ANITA
D: I am. I'm going to take a bubble bath all during supper: Black Orchid.
C: MARIA
D: You will not eat?
C: ANITA
D: After the rumble-with 'Nardo.
N: MARIA [sewing angrily] That rumble, why do they have it?
C: ANITA
D: You saw how they dance: like they have to get rid of something, quick. That's how they fight.
C: MARIA
D: To get rid of what?
C: ANITA
D: Too much feeling. And they get rid of it: after a fight, that brother of yours is so healthy! Definitely: Black Orchid. [There is a knock at the rear door, and Tony enters.]
C: TONY
D: Buenas noches!
C: ANITA [sarcastically to Maria]
D: You go, querida. I will look up. [To Tony:] It's too early for noches. Buenos tardes.
C: TONY [bows]
D: Gracias. Buenas tardes.
C: MARIA
D: He just came to deliver aspirin.
C: ANITA
D: You'll need it.
C: TONY
D: No, we're out of the world.
C: ANITA
D: You're out of your heads.
C: TONY
D: We're twelve feet in the air.
N: MARIA [gently taking his hand] Anita can see all that. [To Anita:] You will not tell?
C: ANITA
D: Tell what? How can I hear what goes on twelve feet over my head? [Opens door. To Maria:] You better be home in fifteen minutes. [She goes out.]
C: TONY
D: Don't worry. She likes us!
C: MARIA
D: But she is worried.
C: TONY
D: She's foolish. We're untouchable; we are in the air; we have magic!
C: MARIA
D: Magic is also evil and black. Are you going to that rumble?
C: TONY
D: No.
C: MARIA
D: Yes.
C: TONY
D: Why??
C: MARIA
D: You must go and stop it.
C: TONY
D: I have stopped it! It's only a fist fight. 'Nardo won't get-
C: MARIA
D: Any fight is not good for us.
C: TONY
D: Everything is good for us and we are good for everything.
C: MARIA
D: Listen and hear me. You must go and stop it.
C: TONY
D: Then I will.
C: MARIA [surprised]
D: Can you?
C: TONY
D: You don't want even a fist fight? There won't be any fight.
C: MARIA
D: I believe you! You do have magic.
C: TONY
D: Of course, I have you. You go home and dress up. Then tonight, I will come by for you.
C: MARIA
D: You cannot come by. My mama...
C: TONY [after a pause]
D: Then I will take you to my house-
C: MARIA [shaking her head]
D: Your mama... [Another awkward pause. Then he sees a female dummy and pushes is forward.]
C: TONY
D: She will come running from the kitchen to welcome you. She lives in the kitchen.
C: MARIA
D: Dressed so elegant?
C: TONY
D: I told her you were coming. She will look at your face and try not to smile. And she will say: Skinny-but pretty.
C: MARIA
D: She is plump no doubt.
N: TONY [holding out the waist of dummy's dress] Fat! MARIA [indicating another female dummy] I take after my mama; delicate-boned. [He kisses her.] Not in front of Mama! [He turns the dummy around as she goes to a male dummy.] Oh, I would like to see Papa in this! Mama will make him ask about your prospects, if you go to church. But Papa-Papa might like you. TONY [kneeling to the "father" dummy] May I have your daughter's hand?
C: TONY
D: Gracias!
C: MARIA
D: And your mama?
C: TONY
D: I'm afraid to ask her.
C: MARIA
D: Tell her she's not getting a daughter; she's getting rid of a son!
C: TONY
D: She says yes.
C: MARIA
D: She has good taste. [She grabs up the wedding veil and puts it on as Tony arranges the dummies.]
C: TONY
D: Maid of honor!
C: MARIA
D: That color is bad for Anita.
C: TONY
D: Best man!
C: MARIA
D: That is my papa!
N: TONY Sorry, Pap. Here we go, Riff: Womb to Tomb! [He takes hat off dummy.]
C: MARIA
D: Now you see, Anita, I told you there was nothing to worry about. [Music starts as she leaves the dummy and walks up to Tony. They look at each other-and the ply acting vanishes. Slowly, seriously, they turn front, and together kneel as before an altar.]
C: TONY
D: I, Anton, take thee Maria...
C: MARIA
D: I, Maria, take thee Anton...
C: TONY
D: For richer, for poorer...
C: MARIA
D: In sickness and in health...
C: TONY
D: To love and to honor...
C: MARIA
D: To hold and to keep...
C: TONY
D: From each sun to each moon...
C: MARIA
D: From tomorrow to tomorrow...
C: TONY
D: For now to forever...
C: MARIA
D: Till death do us part.
C: TONY
D: With this ring, I thee wed.
C: MARIA
D: With this ring, I thee wed.
C: TONY [sings]
D: Make of our hands one hand, Make of our hearts one heart, Make of our vows one last vow: Only death will part us now.
C: MARIA
D: Make of our lives one life, Day after day, one life.
N: BOTH Now it begins, now we start One hand, one heart- Even death won't part us now. [They look at each other, then at the reality of their "game." They smile tenderly, ruefully, and slowly put the dummies back into position. Though brought back to earth, they continue to sing.] Make of our lives one life, Day after day, one life. Now it begins, now we start One hand, one heart- Even death won't part us now. [Very gently, he kisses her hand.]
T: The Lights Fade Out.
N: SCENE EIGHT.
C: 6:00 P.M. The neighborhood.
D: Spotlights pick out Riff and the Jets, Bernardo and the Sharks, Anita, Maria and Tony against small sets representing different places in the neighborhood. All are waiting expectantly for the coming of night, but for very different reasons.
C: JETS [sings]
D: The Jets are gonna have their day Tonight.
C: SHARKS
D: The Sharks are gonna have their way Tonight.
C: JETS
D: The Puerto Rican grumble, Fair fight. But if they start a rumble, We'll rumble 'em right.
C: SHARKS
D: We're gonna hand 'em a surprise Tonight.
C: JETS
D: We're gonna cut 'em down to size Tonight.
C: SHARKS
D: We said, "O.K., no rumpus, No tricks"- But just in case they jump us, We're ready to mix Tonight!
C: BOTH GANGS
D: We're gonna rock it tonight, We're gonna jazz it up and have us a ball.
N: They're gonna get it tonight; The more they turn it on, the harder they'll fall!
C: JETS
D: Well, they began it-
C: SHARKS
D: Well, they began it-
C: BOTH GANGS
D: And we're the ones to stop 'em once and for all, Tonight!
C: ANITA
D: Anita's gonna get her kicks Tonight. We'll have our private little mix Tonight. He'll walk in hot and tired, So what? Don't matter if he's tired, As long as he's hot Tonight!
C: TONY
D: Tonight, tonight, Won't be just any night, Tonight there will be no morning star.
N: Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight And for us, stars will stop where they are. Today The minutes seem like hours, The hours go so slowly, And still the sky is light... Oh moon, grow bright, And make this endless day endless night!
C: RIFF [to Tony]
D: I'm counting on you to be there Tonight When Diesel wins it fair and square Tonight.
N: That Puerto Rican punk'll Go down. And when he's hollered Uncle We'll tear up the town Tonight!
C: MARIA
D: Tonight, tonight Won't be just any night... [She reprises the same chorus Tony has just sung.]
C: RIFF
D: So I can count on you, boy?
C: TONY
D: All right... [Regretting his impatience.] Womb to tomb!
C: RIFF
D: Sperm to worm! I'll see you there about eight...
C: TONY
D: Tonight...
C: BERNARDO and SHARKS
D: We're gonna rock it tonight!!!
C: ANITA
D: Tonight... [All have been singing at once, reprising the choruses they sang before.]
C: BERNARDO and SHARKS
D: We're gonna jazz it tonight They're gonna get it tonight-tonight. They began it-they began it
N: And we're the ones To stop 'em once and for all! The Sharks are gonna have their way, The Sharks are gonna have their day, We're gonna rocks it tonight- Tonight!
C: ANITA
D: Tonight, Late tonight, We're gonna mix it tonight. Anita's gonna have her day, Anita's gonna have her day, Bernardo's gonna have his way Tonight-tonight. Tonight-this very night, We're gonna rock it tonight, Tonight!
C: RIFF and JETS
D: They began it. They began it. We'll stop 'em once and for all The Jets are gonna have their day, The Jets are gonna have their way, We're gonna rock it tonight. Tonight!
C: MARIA
D: Tonight there will be no morning star. Tonight, tonight, I'll se my love tonight. When we kiss, stars will stop where they are.
C: TONY and MARIA
D: Today the minutes seem like hours. The hours go so slowly, And still the sky is light. Oh moon, grow bright, And make this endless day endless night, Tonight! [The lights build with the music to the climax, and then blackout at the final exultant note.]
N: SCENE NINE. 9:00 P.M. Under the highway. A dead end: rotting plaster-and-brick walls and mesh wire
C: fences. A street lamp.
D: It is nightfall. The almost-silhouetted gangs come in from separate sides: climbing over the fences or crawling through holes in the walls. There is silence as they fan out on opposite sides of the cleared space. Then Bernardo and Diesel remove their jackets, handing them to their second: Chino and Riff.
C: BERNARDO
D: Ready.
C: CHINO
D: Ready!
C: DIESEL
D: Ready! Come center and shake hands.
C: BERNARDO
D: For what?
C: RIFF
D: That's how it's done, buddy boy.
C: BERNARDO
D: More gracious living? Look: I don't go for that pretend crap you all go for in this country. Every one of you hates every one of us, and we hate you right back. I don't drink with nobody I hate, I don't shake hands with nobody I hate. Let's get at it.
C: RIFF
D: OK.
C: BERNARDO [moving toward center]
D: Here we go. [Diesel begins to move toward him. There are encouragements called from each sides. The "fair fight" is just beginning when there is an interruption.]
C: TONY
D: Hold it! [He leaps over a fence and starts toward Bernardo.]
C: RIFF
D: Get with the gang.
C: TONY
D: No.
C: RIFF
D: What're you doing?
C: BERNARDO
D: Maybe he has found the guts to fight his own battles.
C: TONY [smiling]
D: It doesn't take guts if you have a battle. But we haven't got one, 'Nardo. [He extends his hand for Bernardo to shake it. Bernardo knocks the hand away and gives Tony a shove that sends him sprawling.]
C: BERNARDO
D: Bernardo.
C: RIFF [quiet, strong]
D: The deal is a fair fight between and Diesel. [To Tony, who has gotten up:] Get with the gang. [During the following, Bernardo flicks Tony's shirt, pushes his shoulder, pinches his cheek.]
C: BERNARDO [To Tony.]
D: I'll give you a battle, Kiddando.
C: DIESEL
D: You've got one.
C: BERNARDO
D: I'll take pretty boy on as a warm-up. Afraid, pretty boy? Afraid, chicken? Afraid, gutless?
C: RIFF
D: Cut that-
C: TONY
D: I don't want to, Bernardo...
C: BERNARDO
D: I'm sure.
C: TONY
D: Bernardo, you've got it wrong.
C: BERNARDO
D: Are you chicken?
C: TONY
D: You won't understand!
C: BERNARDO
D: What d'ya say, chicken?
C: ACTION
D: Get him, Tony!
C: BERNARDO
D: He is chicken.
C: DIESEL
D: Tony-
C: A-RAB
D: Get him!
C: TONY
D: Bernardo, don't.
C: BERNARDO
D: Don't want, pretty little chicken?
C: RIFF
D: Tony, don't just stand-
C: BERNARDO
D: Yellow-bellied chicken-
C: RIFF
D: TONY!
C: ACTION
D: Murder him!
C: SNOWBOY
D: Kill him!
C: BERNARDO
D: Come on, you yellow-bellied Polack bas- [He never finishes, for Riff hauls off and hits him. Immediately, the two gangs alert, and the following action takes on the form of a dance. As Bernardo reels back to his feet, he reaches for his back pocket. Riff reaches for his back pocket, and at the same instant each forth a gleaming knife. They jockey for position, feinting, dueling; the two gangs shift position, now and again temporarily obscuring the fighters. Tony tries to get between them.]
C: RIFF
D: Hold him! [Diesel and Action grab Tony and hold him back. The fight continues. Riff loses his knife, is passed another by a Jet. At last, he has Bernardo in a position where it seems that he will be able to run him through. Tony breaks from Diesel and, crying out, moves to stop Riff.]
C: TONY
D: Riff, don't! [Riff hesitates a moment; the moments is enough for
N: Bernardo-whose hand goes forward with a driving motion, running his knife into Riff. Tony leaps forward to catch Riff. He breaks his fall, then takes the knife in hand, leaps at the triumphant Bernardo. All this happens terribly fast; and Tony rams his knife into Bernardo. The free-for-all continues a moment longer. Then there is a sharp police whistle. Everything comes to a dead stop- dead silence. Then a distant police siren: the kids waver, run one way, another, in panic, confusion. As the stage is cleared, Tony stands, horrified, over the still bodies of Riff and Bernardo. He bends over Riff's body; then he rolls Bernardo's body over-and stares. Then Tony raises his voice in an anguished cry.]
C: MARIA!
D: [Another police whistle, closer now, but he doesn't move. From the shadows, Anybodys appears. She scurries to Tony and tugs at his arm. A siren, another whistle, then a searchlight cuts across the playground. Anybodys' insistent tugging brings Tony to the realization of the danger. He crouches, starts to run with her to one escape way. She reaches it first, goes out-but the searchlight hits it just as he would go through. He stops, runs the other way. He darts here, there, and finally gets away as a distant clock begins to boom.] The Curtain Falls.
N: WEST SIDE STORY ACT II
C: 9:15 P.M. A bedroom.
D: Part of a parlor is also visible. The bedroom as a window opening onto the fire escape, a bed on a wall, a small shrine to the Virgin, and a curtained doorway, rear. There is a door between the bedroom and the parlor. Gay music for Consuelo, who is examining herself in the mirror, and for Rasolia, who is on the bed, finishing her nails.
C: CONSUELO
D: This is my last night as a blonde.
C: ROSALIA
D: No loss.
C: CONSUELO
D: Again! The fortune-teller told Pepe a dark lady was coming into his life.
C: ROSALIA
D: So that's why he's not taking you out after the rumble! [The music becomes festively, humorously Spanish as Maria enters through the curtained doorway. She is finishing getting very dressed up.]
C: MARIA
D: There is not going to be a rumble.
N: ROSALIA Another fortune-teller.
C: CONSUELO
D: Where is Chino escorting you after the rumble-that-is-not-going- to-be-a-rumble?
C: MARIA
D: Chino is escorting me no place.
C: ROSALIA
D: She is just dolling for us. Gracias, querida.
C: MARIA
D: No, not for you. Can you keep a secret?
C: CONSUELO
D: I'm not for secrets!
C: MARIA
D: Tonight is my wedding night!
C: CONSUELO
D: The poor thing is out of her mind.
C: MARIA
D: I am: crazy!
C: ROSALIA
D: She might be at that. She looks somehow different.
C: MARIA
D: I do?
C: ROSALIA
D: And I think she is up to something tonight.
C: MARIA
D: I am?
C: CONSUELO
D: I do? I am? What is going on with you?
C: MARIA [sings] I feel pretty,
D: Oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright, And I pity Any girl who isn't me tonight.
C: I feel charming,
D: Oh so charming, It's alarming how charming I feel, And so pretty That I hardly can believe I'm real.
N: See the pretty girl in that mirror there: Who can that attractive girl be? Such a pretty face, Such a pretty dress, Such a pretty smile, Such a pretty me!
C: I feel stunning
D: And entrancing, Feel like running and dancing for joy, For I'm loved By a pretty wonderful boy!
C: ROSALIA and CONSUELO
D: Have you met my good friend Maria, The craziest girl on the block? You'll know her the minute you see her, She's the one who is in an advanced state of shock.
N: She thinks she's in love. She thinks she's in Spain. She isn't in love, She's merely insane. It must be the heat Or some rare disease, Or too much to eat Or maybe it's fleas. Keep away from her, Send for Chino! This is not the Maria we know! Modest and pure, Polite and refined, Well-bred and mature, And out of her mind!
C: MARIA I feel pretty,
D: Oh so pretty That the city should give me its key.
C: A committee
D: Should be organized to honor me.
C: I feel dizzy, I feel sunny,
D: I feel fizzy and funny and fine, And so pretty, Miss America can just resign! See the pretty girl in that mirror there:
C: ROSALIA and CONSUELO
D: What mirror where?
C: MARIA
D: Who can that attractive girl be?
C: ROSALIA and CONSUELO
D: Which? What? Where? Whom?
C: MARIA
D: Such a pretty face, Such a pretty dress, Such a pretty smile, Such a pretty me!
C: ALL I feel stunning
D: And entrancing, Feel like running and dancing for joy, For I'm loved By a pretty wonderful boy!
C: CHINO [offstage]
D: Maria!
C: CONSUELO
D: It's Chino.
C: ROSALIA
D: The happy bridegroom.
C: CHINO [closer]
D: Maria!
C: MARIA
D: Please-
C: COSUELO
D: Yes, little bride, we're going. [She exits.]
C: ROSALIA
D: They have a quaint old-fashioned custom in this country, Maria: they get married here before the wedding night. [She follows Consuelo out as Chino enters from offstage. His clothes are dirty and torn from the fight. His face is smeared. They shake their heads at him and flounce out. He closes the outer door.]
C: CHINO
D: Maria...
C: MARIA
D: I'm in here. I was just getting ready to-[She is hurriedly trying to put a bathrobe over her dress. Chino comes in before she can finish, so that she leaves it over her shoulders, holding it closed with her hands.]
C: CHINO
D: Where are your parents?
C: MARIA
D: At the store. If I had known you were-You have been fighting, Chino.
C: CHINO
D: Yes, I'm sorry.
C: MARIA
D: That is not like you.
C: CHINO
D: No.
C: MARIA
D: Why, Chino?
C: CHINO
D: I don't know why. It happened so fast.
C: MARIA
D: You must wash up.
C: CHINO
D: Maria-
C: MARIA
D: You can go in there.
C: CHINO
D: In a minute. Maria... at the rumble-
C: MARIA
D: There was no rumble.
C: CHINO
D: There was.
C: MARIA
D: You are wrong.
C: CHINO
D: No; there was. Nobody meant for it to happen...
C: MARIA
D: ...Tell me.
C: CHINO
D: It's bad.
C: MARIA
D: Very bad?
C: CHINO
D: You see... [he moves to her, helplessly]
C: MARIA
D: It will be easier if you say it very fast.
C: CHINO [nods]
D: There was a fight-[She nods.] And 'Nardo-[She nods.] And somehow
N: a knife-and 'Nardo someone-[He takes her hand.]
C: MARIA
D: Tony. What happened to Tony? [The name stops Chino. He yanks off the robe, revealing that she is dressed to go out.] Chino, is Tony all right?!
C: CHINO
D: He killed your brother. [She walks into the parlor, slamming the door behind him. A pause.]
C: MARIA
D: You are lying. [Chino has started to leave the parlor, but comes back now. Swiftly searching behind the furniture, he come up with a n object wrapped in material the same color as Bernardo's shirt. From the bedroom, Maria's voice calls out, louder.] You are lying, Chino! [Coldly, Chino unwraps a gun, which he puts in his pocket. There is the sound of a police siren at a distance. He goes out. During this, Maria has knelt before the shrine on the wall. She rocks back and forth in prayer, some of it in Spanish, some of it in English.] Make it not be true... please make it not be true... I will do anything: make me die... Only, please-make it not be true. [As she prays, Tony appears at the fire-escape window and quietly climbs in. His shirt is ripped, half-torn off. He stands still, limp, watching her. Aware that someone is in the room, she tops her prayers. Slowly, her head turns; she looks at him for a long moment. Then, almost in one spring, she in on him, her fists beating his chest.] Killer, killer, killer,
C: TONY
D: I tried to stop it; I did try. I don't know how it went wrong... I didn't mean to hurt him; I didn't want to; I didn't know I had. But Riff... Riff was like my brother. So when Bernardo killed him-[She lifts her head.] 'Nardo didn't mean it either. Oh, I don't know he didn't! Oh, no. I didn't come to tell you just for you to forgive me so I couldn't go to the police-
C: MARIA
D: No!
C: TONY
D: It's easy now-
C: MARIA
D: No...
C: TONY
D: Whatever you want, I'll do-
C: MARIA
D: Stay. Stay with me.
C: TONY
D: I love you so much.
N: MARIA Tighter. [Music starts.]
C: TONY
D: We'll be all right. I know it. We're really together now.
C: MARIA
D: But it's not us! It's everything around us!
C: TONY
D: Then we'll find some place where nothing can et to us; not one of them, not anything. And- [He sings.] I'll take you away, take you far far away out of here, Far far away till the walls and the streets disappear, Somewhere there must be a place we can feel we're free, Somewhere there's got to be some place for you and for me. [As he sings, the walls of the apartment begin to move off, and the city walls surrounding them begin to close in on them. Then the apartment it self goes, and the two lovers begin to run, battering against the walls of the city, beginning to break through as chaotic figures of the gangs, of violence, fail around them. But they do break through, and suddenly-they are in a world of space and air and sun. They stop, looking at it, pleased, startled, as boys and girls both sides come on. And they, too, stop and stare, happy, pleased. Their clothes are soft and pastel versions of what they have worn before. They begin to dance, to play: no sides, no hostility now; join, making a world that Tony and Maria want to be in, belong to, share their love with. As they go into the steps of a gentle love dance, a voice is heard singing.]
C: OFFSTAGE VOICE [sings]
D: There's a place for us, Somewhere a place for us. Peace and quiet and open air Wait for us Somewhere.
N: There's a time for us, Some day a time for us, Time together with time to spare, Time to look, time to care, Someday! Somewhere. We'll find a new way of living, We'll find a way of forgiving Somewhere, Somewhere... There's a place for us, A time and place for us. Hold my hand and we're half way there. Hold my hand and I'll take you there Someday, Somehow, Somewhere! [The lovers hold out their hands to each other; the others follow suit: Jets to Sharks; Sharks to Jets. And they form what is almost a procession winding its triumphant way through this would-be world, as they sing the words of the song with wonderment. Then, suddenly, there is a dead stop. The harsh shadows, the fire escapes of the real, tenement world cloud the sky, and the figures of Riff and Bernardo slowly walk on. The dream becomes a nightmare: as the city returns, there are brief reenactments of the knife fight, of the deaths. Maria and Tony are once again separated from each other by the violent warring of the two sides. Maria tries to reach Bernardo, Tony tries to stop Riff; the lovers try to reach each other, but they cannot. Chaotic confusion and blackness, after which they find themselves, back in the bedroom, clinging to each other desperately. With a blind refusal to face what they know must be, they reassure each other desperately as they sing.]
C: TONY and MARIA
D: Hold my hand and we're halfway there. Home my hand and I'll take you there Someday, Somehow, Somewhere! [As the lights fade, together they sink back on the bed.]
C: SCENE TWO. 10:00 P.M. Another alley.
D: A fence with loose boards; angles between buildings. Softly, from behind the fence, the Jet gang whistles. A pause, then the answering whistle, softly, from offstage or around a corner. Now a loose board flips up and Baby John wriggles through the fence. He whistles again, timidly, and A-rab comes on.
C: A-RAB
D: They got you yet?
C: BABY JOHN
D: No, you?
C: A-RAB
D: Hell, no.
C: BABY JOHN
D: You seen Tony?
C: A-RAB
D: Nobody has.
C: BABY JOHN
D: Geez...
C: A-RAB
D: You been home yet?
C: A-RAB
D: Uh uh.
C: A-RAB
D: Me either.
C: BABY JOHN
D: Just hidin' around?
C: A-RAB
D: Uh huh.
C: BABY JOHN
D: A-rab... did you get a look at 'em?
C: A-RAB
D: Loot at who?
C: BABY JOHN
D: Ya know. At the rumble. Riff and Bernardo. [Pause.]
C: A-RAB
D: I wish it was yesterday.
C: BABY JOHN
D: Wadaya say we run away?
C: A-RAB
D: What's the matter? You scared?
C: BABY JOHN
D: ...Yeah.
C: A-RAB
D: You cut it out, ya hear? You're only makin' me scared and that scares me! [Police whistle. He grabs Baby John.] Last thing ever is to let a cop know you're scared or anythin'.
C: KRUPKE [offstage]
D: Hey, you two!
C: A-RAB
D: Play it big with the baby blues.
C: BABY JOHN [scared]
D: OK.
C: A-RAB [gripping him]
D: Big, not scare, big! [Again a whistle. Elaborately casual, they start sauntering off as Krupke appears.]
C: KRUPKE
D: Yeah, you. [They stop, so surprised.]
C: A-RAB
D: Why, it is Officer Krupke, Baby John.
C: BABY JOHN [quaking]
D: Top of the evening, Officer Krupke.
C: KRUPKE
D: I'll crack the top of your skulls if you punks don't stop when I whistle.
C: A-RAB
D: But we stopped the very moment we heard.
C: BABY JOHN
D: We got twenty-twenty hearing.
C: KRUPKE
D: You wanna get hauled down to the station house?
C: BABY JOHN
D: Indeed not, sir.
C: KRUPKE
D: I'll make a little deal. I know you was rumblin' under the highway-
C: BABY JOHN
D: We was at the playground, sir.
C: A-RAB
D: We like the playground. It keeps us deprived kids off the foul streets.
C: BABY JOHN
D: It gives us comradeship-
C: A-RAB
D: A place for pleasant pastimes-And for us, born like we was on the hot pavements-
C: KRUPKE
D: OK, wise apples, down to the station house.
C: BABY JOHN
D: Which way?
C: A-RAB
D: This way! [He gets down on all fours, Baby John pushes Krupke, so that he tumbles over A-rab. Baby John pushes Krupke, so that he tumbles over A-rab. Baby John starts off one way, A-rab the other. Krupke hesitates, then runs after one of them, blowing his whistle like mad. The moment he is off, A-rab and Baby John appear through the fence, followed by the other Jets.] Look at the brass-ass run!
C: BABY JOHN
D: I hope he breaks it!
C: ACTION

C: DIESEL [imitating a judge]
D: Right! Officer Krupke, you're really a square; This boy don't need a judge, he needs an analyst's care! It's just his neurosis that oughta be curbed. He's psychologic'ly disturbed!

D: Right! [She starts to run off.]
C: ACTION
D: Hey! [She stops.] You done good, buddy boy.
N: ANYBODYS [she has fallen in love] Thanks, Daddy-o. [They both run off.] The Lights Black Out. SCENE THREE
C: 11:30 P.M. The bedroom.
D: The light is, at first, a vague glow on the lovers, who are sleep on the bed. From offstage, faint at first, there is the sound of knocking. It gets louder; Tony stirs. At a distance, a police siren sounds, and the knocking is now very loud. Tony bolts upright. Anita comes in from outside and goes to the bedroom door-which is locked-tries the knob.
C: ANITA [holding back tears]
D: Maria? ... Maria? [Tony is reaching for his shirt, when Maria sits up. Quickly, he puts his hand, then his lips on her lips.] Maria, it's Anita. Why are you locked in?
C: MARIA
D: I didn't know it was locked.
C: ANITA
D: Open the door. I need you. [Maria reaches for the knob, Tony stops her.]
C: MARIA [a whisper]
D: Now you are afraid, too.
C: ANITA
D: What?
C: MARIA [loud]
D: One moment.
C: TONY [whispering]
D: Doc'll help. I'll get money from him. You meet me at his drugstore.
N: [In the other room, Anita is aware of voices but unsure of what they are saying.] At Doc's, yes. [Aloud.] Coming, Anita!
C: TONY [kisses her]
D: Hurry! [He scrambles out the window as Maria hastily puts a bathrobe on over her slip. In the other room Anita has stiffened and moved away from the door. She stands staring at it coldly as Maria prattles to her through the door.]
C: MARIA
D: Did you see Chino? He was here before, but he left so angry I think maybe he... [She opens the door and sees Anita's look. A moment, then Anita pushes her aside: looks at the bed, at the window, then turns accusingly to Maria.] All right. Now you know.
C: ANITA [savagely]
D: And you still don't know: Tony is one of them! [She sings bitterly.] A boy like that who'd kill your brother, Forget that boy and find another, One of your own kind- Stick to your own kind!
N: A boy like that will give you sorrow- You'll meet another boy tomorrow! One of your own kind, Stick to your own kind! A boy who kills cannot love, A boy who kills has no heart. And he's the boy who gets your love And gets your heart- Very smart, Maria, very smart! A boy like that wants one thing only, And when he's done he'll leave you lonely. He'll murder your love; he murdered mine. Just wait and see- Just wait, Maria, Just wait and see!
C: MARIA
D: Oh, no, Anita, no- Anita, no! It isn't true, not for me, It is true for you, not for me,
C: I hear your words-
D: And in my head
C: I know they're smart,
D: But my heart, Anita, But my heart Knows they're wrong [Anita reprises the chorus she has just sung, as Maria continues her song.]
N: And my heart Is too strong,
C: For I belong
D: To him alone, to him alone.
C: One thing I know: I am his,
D: I don't care what he is. I don't know why it's so, I don't want to know. Oh no, Anita, no-you should know better! You were in love-or so you said. You should know better...
N: I have a love, and it's all that I have. Right or wrong, what else can I do? I love him; I'm his And everything he is
C: I am, too.
D: I have a love and it's all that I need, Right or wrong, and he needs me too. I love him, we're one; There's nothing to be done, Not a thing I can do But hold him, hold him forever, Be with him now, tomorrow And all of my life!
C: BOTH
D: When love comes so strong, There is no right or wrong, Your love is your life!
C: ANITA [quietly]
D: Chino has a gun... He is sending the boys out to hunt for Tony-
N: MARIA [tears off her bathrobe] If he hurts Tony-If he touches him-I swear to you, I'll-
C: ANITA [sharply]
D: You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo?
C: MARIA
D: I love Tony.
C: ANITA
D: I know. I loved Bernardo. [Shrank comes into the outer room.]
C: SCHRANK
D: Anybody home? [Goes to bedroom door, Pleasantly.] Sorry to disturb you. Guess you're disturbed enough.
C: MARIA [gathering her robe]
D: Yes. You will excuse me, please. I must go to my brother.
C: SCHRANK
D: There are just a coupla questions-
C: MARIA
D: Afterwards, please. Later.
C: SCHRANK
D: It'll only take a minute.
C: ANITA
D: Couldn't you wait until-
C: SCHRANK [sharply]
D: No! [A smile to Maria.] You were at the dance at the gym last night.
C: MARIA
D: Yes.
C: SCHRANK
D: Your brother got in a heavy argument because you danced with the wrong boy.
C: MARIA
D: Oh?
C: SCHRANK
D: Who was the wrong boy?
C: MARIA
D: Excuse me. Anita, my head is worse. Will you go to the drugstore and tell them what I need?
C: SCHRANK
D: Don't you keep aspirin around?
C: MARIA
D: This is something special. Will you go for me, Anita?
N: ANITA [hesitates, looks at Maria, then nods.] Shall I tell him to hold it for you till you come?
C: MARIA [to Shrank]
D: Will I be long?
C: SCHRANK
D: As long as it takes.
C: MARIA [to Anita]
D: Yes. Tell him I will pick it up myself. [Anita goes out.] I'm sorry. Now you asked?
C: SCHRANK
D: I didn't ask, I told you. There was an argument over a boy. Who was that boy?
C: MARIA
D: Another from my country.
C: SCHRANK
D: And his name?
C: MARIA
D: Jose. The Lights Are Out.
C: SCENE FOUR 11:40 P.M. The drugstore.
D: A-rab and some of the Jets are there as Anybodys and other Jets run in.
C: ACTION
D: Where's Tony?
C: A-RAB
D: Down in the cellar with Doc.
C: DIESEL
D: Ya warn him about Chino?
C: A-RAB
D: Doc said he'd tell him.
C: BABY JOHN
D: What's he hidin' in the cellar from?
C: SNOWBOY
D: Maybe he can't run as fast as you.
C: ACTION
D: Cut the frabbajabba.
C: ANYBODYS
D: Yeah! The cops'll get hip, if Chino and the PRs don't.
C: ACTION
D: Grab some readin' matter; play the juke. Some of ya get outside and if ya see Chino or any PR- [The shop doorbell tinkles as Anita enters. Cold silence, then slowly she comes down to the counter. They all stare at her. A long moment. Someone turns on the jukebox; a mambo comes on softly.]
C: ANITA
D: I'd like to see Doc.
C: ACTION
D: He ain't here.
C: ANITA
D: Where is he?
C: A-RAB
D: He's gone to the bank. There was an error I his favor.
C: ANITA
D: The banks are closed at night. Where is he?
C: A-RAB
D: You know how skinny Doc is. He slipped in through the night- deposit slot.
C: ANYBODYS
D: And got stuck halfway in.
C: A-RAB
D: Which indicates there's no tellin' when he'll be back. Buenos noches, senorita. [Anita starts to go toward the cellar door.]
C: DIESEL
D: Where you going?
C: ANITA
D: Downstairs to-see Doc.
C: ACTION
D: Didn't I tell ya he ain't here?
C: ANITA
D: I'd like to see for myself.

D: Please.
C: ANITA [controlling herself]
D: ...Please.
C: ACTION
D: Por favor.
C: ANITA
D: Will you let me pass?
C: SNOWBOY
D: She's too dark to pass.
C: ANITA [low]
D: Don't.
C: ACTION
D: Please don't.
C: SNOWBOY
D: Por favor.
C: DIESEL
D: Non comprende.
C: A-RAB

C: ACTION
D: Who says he is?
C: A-RAB
D: Who's the message from?
C: ANITA
D: Never mind.
C: ACTION
D: Couldn't be from Chino, could it?
C: ANITA
D: I want to stop Chino! I want to help!
C: ANYBODYS
D: Bernardo's girl wants ta help?
C: ACTION
D: Even a greaseball's got feelings.
C: ANYBODYS
D: But she wants to help Tony!
C: ANITA
D: No!
C: ACTION
D: Not much-Bernardo's tramp.
C: SNOWBOY
D: Bernardo's pig!
C: ANITA
D: Don't do that!
C: BABY JOHN
D: Gold tooth!
C: DIESEL
D: Pierced ear!
C: A-RAB
D: Garlic mouth!
C: ACTION
D: Spic! Lyin' Spic! [The taunting breaks out into a wild, savage dance, with epithets hurled at Anita, who is encircled and drivers by the whole pack. At the peak, she is shoved so that she falls in a corner. Baby John is lifted up high and dropped on her as Doc enters from the cellar door and yells.]
C: DOC
D: Stop it!... What've you been doing now? [Dead silence. Anita gets up and looks at them.]
N: ANITA [trying not to cry] Bernardo was right... If one of you was bleeding in the street, I'd walk by and spit on you. [She flicks herself off and makes her way toward the door.]
C: ACTION
D: Don't let her go!
C: DIESEL
D: She'll tell Chino that Tony- [Snowboy grabs her; she shakes loose.]
C: ANITA
D: Let go! [Facing them.] I'll give you a message for your American buddy! Tell the murderer Maria's never going to meet him! Tell him Chino found out and-and shot her! [She slams out. There is a stunned silence.]
C: DOC
D: What does it take to get through to you? When do you stop? You make this world lousy!
C: ACTION
D: That's the way we found it, Doc.
C: DOC
D: Get out of here! [Slowly, they start to file out.] The Lights Fade.
C: 11:50 P.M. The Cellar.
D: Cramped: a box or crate; stairs leading to the drugstore above; a door to the outside. Tony is sitting on a crate, whistling "Maria" as Doc comes down the stairs, some bills in his hand.
C: TONY
D: Make a big sale?
C: DOC
D: No.
N: TONY [taking the money that Doc is holding] Thanks. I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
C: DOC
D: For get that.
C: TONY
D: I won't; I couldn't. Doc, you know what we're going to do in the country, Maria and me? We're going to have kids and we'll name them all after you, even the girls. Then when you come to visit-
C: DOC [slaps him]
D: Wake up! [Raging.] Is that the only way to get through to you? Do just what you all do? Bust like a hot-water pipe?
C: TONY
D: Doc, what's gotten-
C: DOC [overriding angrily]
D: Why do you live like there's a war on? [Low.] Why do you kill?
C: TONY
D: I told you how it happened, Doc. Maria understands. Why can't you?
C: DOC
D: I never had a Maria.
C: TONY [gently]
D: I have, and I'll tell you one thing, Doc. Even if it only lasts from one night to the next, it's worth the world.
C: DOC
D: That's all it did last.
C: TONY
D: What?
C: DOC
D: That was no costumer upstairs, just now. That was Anita. [Pause.] Maria is dead. China found out about you and her-and shot her. [A brief moment. Tony looks at Doc, stunned, numb. He shakes his head, as though he cannot believe this. Doc holds out his hands to him, but Tony backs away, then suddenly turns and runs out the door. As he does, the set flies away and the stage goes dark. In the darkness, we heaver Tony's voice.]
C: TONY
D: Chino? Chino? Come and get me, too, Chino.
N: SCENE SIX Midnight. The street. The lights come up to reveal the same set we saw at the beginning of Act One-but it is now jagged with shadows. Tony stands in the emptiness, calling, whirling around as a figure darts out of the shadows and then runs off again.
C: TONY
D: Chino?... COME ON: GET ME TOO!
N: ANYBODYS [a whisper from the dark] Tony...
C: TONY [swings around]
D: Who's that?
C: ANYBODYS [darting on]
D: Me: Anybodys.
C: TONY
D: Get outa here. HEY, CHINO! COME GET ME, DAMN YOU!
C: ANYBODYS
D: What're you doin', Tony?
C: TONY
D: I said get outa here! CHINO!
C: ANYBODYS
D: Look, maybe if you and me just-
C: TONY [savagely]
D: It's not playing any more! Can't any of you get that?
C: ANYBODYS
D: But the gang-
C: TONY
D: You're a girl: be a girl! Beat it. [She retreats.] CHINO, I'M CALLING FOR YOU, CHINO! HURRY! IT'S CLEAR NOW. THERE'S NOBODY BUT ME. COME ON! Will you, please? I'm waiting for you. I want you to- [Suddenly, all the way across the stage from him, a figure steps out of the dark. He stops and peers as light starts to glow on it. He utters an unbelieving whisper.] Maria... Maria?
C: MARIA
D: Tony... [As she holds out her arms toward him, another figure appears: Chino.]
N: TONY MARIA! [As they run to each other, there is a gunshot. Tony stumbles, as though he has tripped. Maria catches him and cradles him in her arms as he falters to the ground. During this Baby John and A-rab run on; then Pepe and Indio and other Sharks. Chino stands very still, bewildered by the gun dangling from his hand. More Jets and Sharks, some girls run on, and Doc comes out to stare with them.] I didn't believe hard enough.
C: MARIA
D: Long is enough.
C: TONY
D: Not here. They won't let us be.
C: MARIA
D: Then we'll get away.
C: TONY
D: Yes, we can. We sill. [He shivers, as though a pain went through him. She holds him closer and begins to sing-without orchestra.]
C: MARIA
D: Hold my hand and we're halfway there. Hold my hand and I'll take you there, Someday, Somehow... [He has started to join in on the second line. She sings harder, as though to urge him back to life, but his voice falters and he barely finishes the line. She sings on, a phrase or two more, then stops, his body quiet in her arms. A moment, and then, as she gently rests Tony on the floor, the orchestra finishes the last bars of the song. Lightly, she brushes Tony's lips with her fingers. Behind her, Action, in font of a group of Jets, moves to lead them toward Chino. Maria speaks, her voice cold, sharp.] Stay back. [The shawl she has had around her shoulders slips to the ground as she gets up, walks to Chino and holds out her hand. He hands her the gun. She speaks again, in a flat, hard voice.] How do you fire this gun, Chino? Just by pulling this little trigger? [She points it at him suddenly; he draws back. She has all of them in front of her now, as she holds the gun out and her voice gets stronger with anger and savage rage.] How many bullets are left, Chino? Enough for you? [Pointing at another.] And you? [At Action.] All of you? WE ALL KILLED HIIM; and my brother and Riff. I, too. I CAN KILL NOW BECAUSE I HATE NOW. [She has been pointing the gun wildly, and they have all been drawing back. Now, again, she holds it straight out at Action.] How many can I kill, Chino? How many-and still have one bullet left for me? [Both hands on the gun, she breaks into tears, hurls the gun away and sinks to the ground. Schrank walks on looks around and starts toward Tony's body. Like a madwoman, Maria races to the body [She kisses him gently. Music starts as the two Jets and two Sharks lift up Tony's body and start to carry him out. The others, boys and girls, fall in behind to make a procession, the same procession they made in the dream ballet, as Baby John comes forward to pick up Maria's shawl and put it over her head. She sits quietly, like a woman in mourning, as the music builds, the light starts to come up and the procession makes its way across the stage. At last, she gets up and, despite the tears on her face, lifts her head proudly, and triumphantly turns to follow the others. The adults-Doc, Schrank, Krupke, Glad Hand-are left bowed, alone, useless.] The Curtain Falls.
